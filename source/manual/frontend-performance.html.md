GOV.UK uses [SpeedCurve](https://speedcurve.com/) to track the performance of the frontend, using Real User Metrics (RUM). Significant changes to performance are automatically posted to the #govuk-web-performance Slack channel.

[Technical implementation details](/repos/govuk_publishing_components/real-user-metrics.html).

The Speedcurve account is administered by the frontend community, ask on #govuk-frontenders if you need to know more.
