Our Jenkins installations ([deploy](https://deploy.integration.publishing.service.gov.uk/) and [CI](https://ci.integration.publishing.service.gov.uk/)) use GitHub for authentication and authorisation. You need to be added to the [GOV.UK team][govuk-team] by a GitHub administrator (usually a senior tech), otherwise you won't see any projects, or will see a message that you're unauthorised.
