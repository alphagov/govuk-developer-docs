Our Jenkins installations ([deploy](https://deploy.integration.publishing.service.gov.uk/) and [CI](https://ci.integration.publishing.service.gov.uk/)) use GitHub for authentication and authorisation.

- For integration access, you need to be added to the [GOV.UK team][govuk-team]
- For staging and production access, you need to be added to the [GOV.UK Production team][govuk-production]

This can be done by a GitHub administrator (usually a senior tech), otherwise you won't see any projects, or will see a message that you're unauthorised. Try asking in the `#govuk-tech-leads` Slack channel.
