Our Jenkins installations ([deploy](https://deploy.integration.publishing.service.gov.uk/) and [CI](https://ci.integration.publishing.service.gov.uk/)) use GitHub for authentication and authorisation.

- For integration access, you need to be added to the [GOV.UK team][]
- For staging and production access, you need to be added to the [GOV.UK Production team][]

Without this you won't see any projects or you'll see a message that says you are unauthorised.

Usually your tech lead or a member of senior tech can add you to the right team in GitHub. Try asking in the `#govuk-tech-leads` Slack channel if you're struggling to find someone.
