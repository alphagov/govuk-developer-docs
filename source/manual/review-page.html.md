How to review pages in this manual.

## Questions to ask

- Is the page accurate?
- Is the page still relevant?
- Should it still be there?
- Does it help the reader complete their task?
- Is it incomplete?
- Does the page contain information easily available elsewhere?

## When you've reviewed the page, either:

- Update the page
- Remove it (don’t forget to [set up a redirect][redirects])
- Assign it for someone else to review
- Confirm the page is OK and set a new review date

These tasks can be achieved by editing the metadata at the top of the source for that page. See the [govuk-developer-docs github repo](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-developer-docs).

## Set a review by date

- How likely is it that the information will change?
- Is work happening in this area?
- What would the impact be if the information were wrong?

## Relevant blog posts to link to

Is there a relevant blog post to the page you're reviewing? Would linking to it help the reader complete their task?

You can find [GOV.UK blog posts on the  GDS Tech blog](https://gdstechnology.blog.gov.uk/category/gov-uk/).
