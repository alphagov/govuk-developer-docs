# Review a page in this manual

How to review pages in the dev manual.

## Questions to ask

- Is the page accurate?
- Is the page still relevant?
- Should it still be there?
- Does it help the reader complete their task?
- Is it incomplete?
- Does the page contain information easily available elsewhere?
- Does the page contain sensitive or inappropriate information? For example passwords, individual email addresses, groups, calendars, 'secret' links.

## Options

- Update the page
- Remove it (donâ€™t forget to set up a redirect)
- Assign it for someone else to review
- Confirm the page is OK and set a new review date

## Set a review by date

- How likely is it that the information will change?
- Is work happening in this area?
- What would the impact be if the information were wrong?

## Relevant blog posts to link to

Is there a relevant blog post to the page you're reviewing? Would linking to it help the reader complete their task?
