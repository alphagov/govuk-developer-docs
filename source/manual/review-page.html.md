# Review a page in this manual

How to review pages in the dev manual.

## Questions to ask

Is the page accurate?
is the page still relevant?
Should it still be there?
Does it help the reader complete their task?
Is it incomplete?
Does the page contain information easily available elsewhere?
Does the page contain sensitive or inappropriate information? For example passwords, individual email addresses, groups, calendars, 'secret' links.

## Options

- update the page
- remove it (donâ€™t forget to set up a redirect)
- assign it for someone else to review
- confirm the page is OK and set a new review date

## Set a review by date

How likely is it that the information will change?
Is work happening in this area?
What would the impact be if the information were wrong?

## Relevant blog posts to link to

Is there a relevant blog post to the page you're reviewing? Would linking to it help the reader complete their task?

Example blog posts (as of April 2017):
