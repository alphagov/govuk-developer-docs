## How we run RabbitMQ

We run a RabbitMQ cluster, which is used to trigger events when
documents are published. The general process is that messages are
published onto "exchanges" in RabbitMQ. Applications create "queues"
which listen to the exchanges, and gather the messages sent to the
exchanges together. Applications then run "consumers" which receive
messages from the queues.

In order to ensure that our consumers remain active, we publish
"heartbeat" messages to the exchanges every minute. This helps to avoid
problems with consumers dropping their connections due to inactivity,
but also allows us to monitor activity easily.

### Sending heartbeats

Heartbeat messages are sent every minute by cron. Currently, we only
send heartbeat messages to one exchange: the `published_documents`
exchange. These heartbeats are sent via a [rake task][heartbeat_rake_task]
in the `publishing-api` app.

[heartbeat_rake_task]: https://github.com/alphagov/publishing-api/blob/012cb3f1ceb3b18e7059a367cc4030aa0763afb4/lib/tasks/heartbeat_messages.rake

## Connecting to the RabbitMQ web control panel

1.  Create an SSH tunnel to access the web control panel

    For example for integration:

    > ssh rabbitmq-1.backend.integration -L 15672:127.0.0.1:15672

2.  Log in to the web control panel

    Point your browser at <http://127.0.0.1:15672>

    The username is root. The password you can obtain from the govuk-secrets
    repo. Look for govuk\_rabbitmq::root\_password in the file for the
    relevant environment in
    <https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-secrets/tree/master/puppet/hieradata>

3.  Do your business
4.  Tidy up

    Close the SSH connection you set up earlier with CTRL+C or by typing
    "exit".

## Inspecting/removing items from a queue

We had an instance where an application was unable to process a message
in the queue, but left the message on the queue. This meant it was
backing up. Removing the message from the queue was the right solution
in our case.

1.  Find the queue

    Click on the "Queues" tab. Then click on the name of the queue.

2.  Find the messages

    Scroll down and click "Get messages". Clicking the "Get Message(s)"
    button that appears will fetch however many messages you ask for.

    Note: Fetching messages actually removes them from the queue. By leaving
    the "Requeue" option set to "Yes", they will be added back to queue.

3.  Delete the messages

    Note: there is a risk that you might delete the wrong message(s). This
    is because the contents of the queue may have changed.

    Repeat, but change the "Requeue" option to "No".

## Previewing a message for a document_type

The publishing API generates messages when content is updated and posts them
to the rabbitMQ exchange. Each message has a shared format, however the contents
of the message is affected by the publishing app and what data it sends to the
publishing API.

As messages for different formats can vary, we have created a rake task in the
publishing API app to allow us to easily generate example messages. The example
message is generated from the most recently published message (based off of
last public_updated_at) for the entered document type:

```
bundle exec rake queue:preview_recent_message[<document_type>]
```
