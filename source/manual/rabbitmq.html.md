[RabbitMQ][RabbitMQ] is a message broker based on the [Advanced Message Queuing
Protocol][AMQP] (AMQP).

[Learn more about RabbitMQ][rabbitmq_tutorial].

## Connecting to the RabbitMQ web control panel

Run `gds govuk connect rabbitmq -e integration aws/rabbitmq` and point your
browser at <http://127.0.0.1:15672> (also available for `staging` and `production`).

The username for connecting to the RabbitMQ web control panel is `root` and the password
can be decrypted from the `govuk-secrets` repo via `bundle exec rake 'eyaml:decrypt_value[integration,govuk_rabbitmq::root_password]'` (from the `puppet_aws` directory).

## RabbitMQ metrics

A [generic RabbitMQ dashboard][rabbitmq-dashboard] shows metrics for queues and exchanges.

## How we run RabbitMQ

### Overview

**Producer**: an application that publishes messages RabbitMQ. On GOV.UK this could
be [publishing-api](https://github.com/alphagov/publishing-api).

**Exchanges** are AMQP entities where messages are sent. They take a message
and route it into zero or more queues. The routing algorithm used depends on
the exchange type and rules called _bindings_.  When a content change is made
in a publishing application (e.g. Travel Advice Publisher), Publishing API
[publishes a message][publishing_api_publishes_message] to our main exchange,
`publishing_documents`.

**Queues** are very similar to queues in other message and task-queueing
systems: they store messages that are consumed by applications. An example of a
queue is `email_alert_service` which is used by
[email-alert-service][email-alert-service] to forward publishing activity to
email-alert-api. Queues are [created by consumer applications][create_queues].

**Bindings** are rules that exchanges use (among other things) to route
messages to queues. To instruct an exchange E to route messages to a queue Q, Q
has to be bound to E. Bindings may have an optional routing key attribute. An
example of a binding is the `cache_clearing_service-high` queue is
[bound][binding_config] to the `published_documents` exchange with a routing
key matching of `*.major`. E.g messages sent to the exchange with a routing key
of `guide.major` will be routed to that queue.

**Messages** consist of a JSON payload and publish options (we predominantly
use content type, routing key and persistant).

Options:

* content_type (string) - tells the consumer the type of message. E.g
  `"application/json"`
* routing_key (string) - matches against bindings to filter messages to certain
  queues. E.g `"guide.major"`
* persistant (boolean) - tells RabbitMQ whether to save the message to disk.

Message options are set when a message is published. In our use case, the
message's payload is the content item in JSON format. The code in the
publishing-api to publish a message is [here][publish_message_call].

**Consumer applications** are applications which consume messages from one or
more queues. For email-alert-service this is done by [running this rake
task][message_processors] and using the [major change
processor][major_message_processor] to do the processing of the consumed
messages. All our consumer applications use the
[govuk_message_queue_consumer][message_consumer] gem to consume messages from
RabbitMQ in a standardised way.

You can see live examples of things like queues, exchanges, bindings etc by
connecting to the RabbitMQ control panel.
