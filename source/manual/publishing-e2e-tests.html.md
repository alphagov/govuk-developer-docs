We have [end to end tests][repo] running against proposed changes to applications to verify
that the change doesn't break flows interacting with multiple applications.

## Flaky tests

These tests execute through the UI, and can be fragile and flaky as a result.  Rerunning a build may fix the immediate
problem but [you are implored to tackle the root cause][flaky-tests-guide].

## Test against branch

The test-against branch is used by [Jenkins when executing the test suite][jenkins-test-against] against proposed
changes.  This branch should get pushed to automatically whenever a change is made to master branch.  On occasion the
master branch has failed due to the flaky nature of the test suite causing test-against to
[become behind master][compare-test-against-master].  [Rerunning the master branch build][rebuild-master-branch] should fix it.

## How to add new tests

If you are writing a new publishing application or wanting to cover new end to end flows you are advised to
[read the guidance on Github][add-new-tests-guidance].
