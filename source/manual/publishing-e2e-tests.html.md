Most GOV.UK applications are run against a [end-to-end test suite](https://github.com/alphagov/publishing-e2e-tests) as part of their build process. This is done to determine if a change in one application has a negative impact on a dependant application and to test the changed application is functioning correctly in a quasi-production environment.

There is specific documentation available on:

- [what belongs in the test suite](https://github.com/alphagov/publishing-e2e-tests/blob/master/docs/what-belongs-in-these-tests.md)
- [how to debug a failing test in jenkins](https://github.com/alphagov/publishing-e2e-tests/blob/master/docs/debugging-failures.md)
- [how to resolve breaking changes](https://github.com/alphagov/publishing-e2e-tests/blob/master/docs/breaking-app-change.md)
- [how to handle intermittently failing (flakey) tests](https://github.com/alphagov/publishing-e2e-tests/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md#dealing-with-flaky-tests)
- [how to add new tests/applications](https://github.com/alphagov/publishing-e2e-tests/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)
