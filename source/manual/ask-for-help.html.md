If you and your colleagues can’t resolve a technical issue, problem or question, you should try talking with (in this order):

1. Your tech lead (TL)
1. [#govuk-tech-leads](https://gds.slack.com/channels/govuk-tech-leads)
1. The [senior tech team](#contact-senior-tech)

## Contact Senior Tech

You can ping `@govuk-senior-tech-people` on Slack, or email [govuk-senior-tech-members](https://groups.google.com/a/digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/g/govuk-senior-tech-members/members).

## Contact Technical Support of the relevant area of GOV.UK

There are channels for each area of GOV.UK:

- `#govuk-ask-platform-engineering`
- `#govuk-publishing-service-support`
- `#govuk-web-support`

## Escalate to Technical On-Call

There's a `#govuk-technical-on-call` channel that can be used to communicate with the on-call engineers in a public forum, in-hours only.

Out of hours, or if you need to escalate urgently in-hours, create an incident in PagerDuty:

- Impacted Service: "GOV.UK"
- Urgency" "High"
- Assignee: “GOV.UK Regular Coverage”)
- Fill out the incident detail and create the incident

This causes the engineer(s) to be paged by PagerDuty.
