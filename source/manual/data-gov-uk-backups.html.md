## Local backups

Backups of the local PostgreSQL database are made every day and stored in `/media/hulk/backup` on the server. The last few daily backups are kept, after which the retention period decreases to one backup per month.

## Bytemark backups

As part of their managed service, Bytemark takes daily offsite backups of the whole server, which are kept for 7 days, after which time the last 4 monthly backups are kept.

Access to these backups is via a Bytemark support ticket. Contact the Platform Health team who have named contacts set up with Bytemark for support requests.
