# Important Treasury Publishing

When the Chancellor of the Exchequer presents a new Budget or Autumn Statement, generally HM Treasury will ask GDS to sign a contract saying we will not deploy "software changes" to GOV.UK during the day of the announcement of the Budget.

This means a deploy freeze is generally needed from mid afternoon on the day before the announcement until mid morning on the day following the announcement.

For the announcement itself, the Content team at Treasury will publish a set of documents using Whitehall from when the Chancellor sits down after making his speech in the Commons. Once they have done this, they will ask GDS to purge a set of URLs from the cache. These URLs may be provided to us beforehand but should be double checked. Follow the instructions for a [cache flush](../cache-flush.html) for each URL.
