# Create a new open source project

We try to [code in the
open](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2012/10/12/coding-in-the-open/) by default
whenever possible at GDS.

When time permits, GDS Operations will go a step further by committing
to maintaining a project as open source software such that it's easily
usable by external people and organisations out of the box.

## Guidelines for open source projects

Open source projects should follow our [open source
guidelines](https://gds-operations.github.io/guidelines/).

## Where to host open source repositories

Open source repositories created by GDS Operations should be hosted
under our [GDS operations GitHub
organisation](https://github.com/gds-operations).

When creating a new repository, ensure that you [update the repository
data](https://github.com/gds-operations/gds-operations.github.io/blob/master/_README.md)
used by the [GDS open source web
site](https://gds-operations.github.io/).
