When transitioning HTTPS domains, these are the steps to request a TLS
certificate from Fastly.

1. Use the 2nd line account to login to Fastly.

1. Go to Configure > Switch services

1. Select “Production Bouncer” and search for the domain

*Note: If domain is not listed you may need to re-run [CDN: deploy Bouncer configs](https://deploy.blue.production.govuk.digital/job/Bouncer_CDN/) Jenkins job.*

1. Go to HTTPS and network > Secure another domain

1. Enter the domain name you want TLS certificate to be created. Select a corresponding TLS configuration:

**gds_bouncer** - for any domain name which resolves to:

```
- bouncer-cdn.production.govuk.service.gov.uk
- bouncer.gds.map.fastly.net
- 151.101.2.30, 151.101.66.30, 151.101.130.30, 151.101.194.30
```

**govuk** - for any domain name which resolves to:

```
- backend.production.alphagov.co.uk
- redirector-cdn.production.govuk.service.gov.uk
- redirector-cdn-ssl-businesslink.production.govuk.service.gov.uk
- redirector-cdn-ssl-directgov.production.govuk.service.gov.uk
- redirector-cdn-ssl-events-businesslink.production.govuk.service.gov.uk
- www-cdn.production.govuk.service.gov.uk
- www-gov-uk.map.fastly.net
- 151.101.0.144, 151.101.64.144, 151.101.128.144, 151.101.192.144
```

1. At this point, a unique domain [ownership validation](https://docs.fastly.com/en/guides/serving-https-traffic-using-fastly-managed-certificates#verifying-domain-ownership) record (`_acme-challenge`) is generated by Fastly.

1. ACME DNS validation method (with “_acme-challenge” record) should be used for all HSTS protected domains (e.g. find-coronavirus-support.service.gov.uk, *.service.gov.uk) and domains currently available over the HTTPS. This is to allow GOV.UK team to test and prevent service going offline during the certificate creation process (as per a [warning](https://docs.fastly.com/en/guides/serving-https-traffic-using-fastly-managed-certificates#using-the-acme-http-challenge-to-verify-domain-ownership) in Fastly documentation).

*Note: for domain names which already resolve to Fastly IPs/CNAME and do not have services available over the HTTPS  you can select “Alternative domain verification method”. This option automatically verifies domain ownership using ACME HTTP method.*

1. After domain ownership is confirmed the certificate should be enabled.
