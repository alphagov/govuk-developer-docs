title: Change a specialist document base path

In [Specialist Publisher](https://specialist-publisher.publishing.service.gov.uk/), the base path is automatically generated based on the title when the document is first created. We sometimes receive Zendesk tickets to change a base path when the title has been updated, as the publisher does not have the ability to do this.

<%= RunRakeTask.links("specialist-publisher", "base_path:edit[content_id,locale,new_base_path]") %>

You can find the `content_id` and `locale` of the document using the [govuk-toolkit](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-browser-extension) browser extension.

> **Note**: the rake task will only change the slug for the latest draft (creating a new draft if necessary). For the change to be permanent, you need to publish the draft, which you can either do in the Specialist Publisher UI or by using the CLI:

```sh
$ gds govuk connect app-console -e production specialist-publisher
```
```ruby
Document.find('content_id-of-the-document').publish
```
