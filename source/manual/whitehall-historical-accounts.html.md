## Adding Historical Accounts to Whitehall

People in Whitehall can have a biography attached to each role they have held. These are called Historical Accounts. We primarily use Historical Accounts to add information to our History of Government's [Notable People](https://www.gov.uk/government/history#notable-people) section. For example, most [past prime ministers](https://www.gov.uk/government/history/past-prime-ministers) have one.

Historical accounts can be added though the [Whitehall Admin Interface](https://whitehall-admin.integration.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/admin).

Log in to Whitehall Admin and click the 'More' tab in the top right of the page, then select the 'People' option.
