Sometimes, there is a need to manually redirect existing URLs to another
internal location, usually due to content being archived or because the
slug has been changed.

There is also a regular requirement for creating short URLs on behalf of
departments, usually for use with for campaign materials.

## Getting information on current redirects

To find if there is already a redirect for a particular path:

    $ ssh router-backend-1.router.production
    $ govuk_app_console router-api
    > Route.where(incoming_path: '/path-to-item')

Redirect routes have the handler 'redirect'.

## Redirecting from the original publishing app

The preferred method of creating redirects is to use the publishing app that originally published the content to unpublish it and redirect it to another page using the Publishing API.

This ensures that the workflow and publishing history stays within the app wherever possible.

## Using the Short URL Manager

If the redirect is from a URL that is not a currently-published content item, you should first look to use the [Short URL Manager](https://short-url-manager.publishing.service.gov.uk) to create a redirect request. Requests are checked and approved by content designers, after which they are made live.

Redirects created in Short URL Manager are published via the Publishing API.

Specific Signon [permissions][short-url-manager-permissions] are
required to make and approve redirect requests through the Short URL
Manager. Additionally, there is a `advanced_options` permission which
enables creating `prefix` type redirects, and using non-default values
for the `segments_mode`.

## Using router-data

If you need to put a redirect in place without changing the content in
the Publishing API, then [router-data][router-data] can be
used. Follow the [README](router-data-README) to create your redirects
in a new branch and open a pull request.

## Fixing incorrect Corporate Information page redirects

There have been a few occasions where Corporate Information pages have
started redirecting the English version to a translation. Should this
happen, the redirects can be identified with:

    $ ssh router-backend-1.router.production
    $ govuk_app_console router-api
    > Route.where(incoming_path: /\/about/).each do |route|
    >   puts "#{route.id} #{route.incoming_path} -> #{route.redirect_to}" if route.handler == "redirect"
    > end

That will list the id and paths for each redirect. Redirects from the
English version to a translation, for example:

    579a109cd068b406250014e4 /government/organisations/companies-house/about/access-and-opening -> /government/organisations/companies-house/about/access-and-opening.cy

...can be deleted with

    Route.find('579a109cd068b406250014e4').destroy

For the deleted routes to take effect, you need to reload the router.

    > RouterReloader.reload

## Redirects from Campaign sites

The campaign platform is a WP site managed by DXW. For redirects to be put in place from a `*.campaign.gov.uk` site we need to raise a support ticket with them and request for them to do this for us. Currently Mark McLeod or Kelvin Gan can raise a ticket.
