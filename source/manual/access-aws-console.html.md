Accessing AWS is done via a command-line tool called the GDS CLI.

It's a tool that's developed and supported by Reliability Engineering, but open to anyone inside GDS to contribute to. It's written in Go. It's used by many teams across GDS to make daily AWS-related tasks easier.

The (private) GitHub repo is [alphagov/gds-cli](https://github.com/alphagov/gds-cli). There's a [comprehensive README](https://github.com/alphagov/gds-cli#readme).

## Installation

1. Install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) on macOS or Linux.
1. Run `brew install alphagov/gds/gds-cli` to install from the [GDS Homebrew tap](https://github.com/alphagov/homebrew-gds).
1. Run `gds config yubikey false` if you type AWS MFA codes from your phone.

If you have `bash-completion` installed and configured, the gds-cli tab completions will work out of the box. They're especially useful for long commands like AWS account names.

## Get Your Role

Work out which [list of users you're part of in govuk-aws-data][govuk-aws-data-users-group].
You're about to use it in the 'Web Console' section below.

## Usage

### Web Console

If you're new to GOV.UK and want to look around in integration:

        gds aws govuk-integration-readonly -l

Replace `readonly` with the non-pluralised version of your role name. For example,
if you want to assume the `govuk-powerusers` role on Staging, you would run
`gds aws govuk-staging-poweruser -l`.

`-l` opens the web browser and logs you in. For a full list of CLI parameters,
consult the [gds-cli README](https://github.com/alphagov/gds-cli).

### Terraform

### Terminal Commands

You can also chain commands, like this one to list S3 buckets in integration:

        gds aws govuk-integration-poweruser aws s3 ls

[govuk-aws-data-users-group]: /manual/set-up-aws-account.html#4-get-the-appropriate-access
