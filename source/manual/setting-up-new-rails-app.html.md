## Before you start

Before you create a Ruby on Rails (“Rails”) app, you must complete all steps in the [GOV.UK developer get started documentation][get-started].

You should:

- develop your Rails app in line with the [conventions for Rails applications][rails-conv]
- name your Rails app in line with the [conventions for naming apps][naming]

## Create a new Rails app

1. To create a Rails app on your local machine, run the following in the command line:

    ```sh
    rails new myapp --skip-javascript --skip-test --skip-bundle --skip-spring --skip-action-cable --skip-action-mailer --skip-active-storage
    ```

    The `--skip` commands exclude unneeded Rails components.

1. Include the gems you need for your app in `Gemfile`. For example:

    ```rb
    source "https://rubygems.org"

    gem "rails", "6.0.3.4"

    gem "bootsnap",
    gem "gds-api-adapters"
    gem "gds-sso"
    gem "govuk_app_config"
    gem "govuk_publishing_components"
    gem "pg"
    gem "plek"
    gem "uglifier"

    group :development do
      gem "listen"
    end

    group :test do
      gem "simplecov"
    end

    group :development, :test do
      gem "byebug"
      gem "govuk_test"
      gem "rspec-rails"
      gem "rubocop-govuk"
    end
    ```

1. Run `bundle && rails g rspec:install` to install all the gems you included in `Gemfile` and generate files you can use to test your app.

1. Run `rm spec/rails_helper.rb` to delete `spec/rails_helper.rb`.

1. Replace the contents of `spec/spec_helper.rb` with the following:

    ```rb
    ENV["RAILS_ENV"] ||= "test"

    require "simplecov"
    SimpleCov.start "rails"

    require File.expand_path("../../config/environment", __FILE__)
    require "rspec/rails"

    Dir[Rails.root.join("spec/support/**/*.rb")].each { |f| require f }
    GovukTest.configure

    RSpec.configure do |config|
      config.expose_dsl_globally = false
      config.infer_spec_type_from_file_location!
      config.use_transactional_fixtures = true
    end
    ```

1. If your Rails app has a database, replace the content of `config/database.yml` with the following:

    ```yaml
    default: &default
      adapter: postgresql
      encoding: unicode
      pool: 12
      template: template0

    development:
      <<: *default
      database: <APP-NAME>_development
      url: <%= ENV["DATABASE_URL"]%>

    test:
      <<: *default
      database: <APP-NAME>_test
      url: <%= ENV["TEST_DATABASE_URL"] %>

    production:
      <<: *default
      database: <APP-NAME>_production
      url: <%= ENV["DATABASE_URL"]%>
    ```

    where `<APP-NAME>` is the name of your Rails app.

1. Delete the `config/credentials.yml.env` and `config/master.key` files, and create a `config/secrets.yml` file that contains the following:

    ```yaml
    development:
      secret_key_base: secret

    test:
      secret_key_base: secret

    production:
      secret_key_base: <%= ENV['SECRET_KEY_BASE'] %>
    ```

1. Replace the content of `config/routes.rb` with the following:

    ```rb
    Rails.application.routes.draw do
      get "/healthcheck/live", to: proc { [200, {}, %w[OK]] }
      get "/healthcheck/ready", to: GovukHealthcheck.rack_response
    end
    ```

1. Configure linting for your Rails app to make sure the app's code is consistent with other GOV.UK apps. Find out more information about [configuring linting][linting].

### Set up a Unicorn web server

1. If your Rails app's `Gemfile` includes `gem "puma"`, open `Gemfile` and delete `gem "puma"`.

1. Create a `Procfile` in your app's root directory that contains the following:

    ```
    web: bundle exec unicorn -c ./config/unicorn.rb -p ${PORT:-3000}
    ```

1. Create a `config/unicorn.rb` file that contains the following code:

    ```
    require "govuk_app_config/govuk_unicorn"
    GovukUnicorn.configure(self)
    ```

### Add your Rails app to GOV.UK Docker

Add your Rails app to GOV.UK Docker so you can run the app locally. See an [example GOV.UK Docker pull request](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-docker/pull/465).

## Set up a GitHub repo for your Rails app

When you’ve finished developing your Rails app, you can [set up a GitHub repo for your Rails app][auto-config].

You must add a description to the _About_ section in the GitHub repo, or the GOV.UK developer documentation build will break when it tries to build the [list of apps][app-list].

### Add a software licence

You must add a `LICENCE` file to your project’s root folder that specifies the software licence. You should usually use the following MIT License text. Replace <YEAR> with the current year.

```

```

### Replace the default README.md

Change the default `README.md` file to match [the standard README template](/manual/readmes.html#template-for-new-readmes).

### Write API documentation

If your app is an API, you should create a `docs/api.md` file.

[Guidance on writing API reference documentation on GOV.UK](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/writing-api-reference-documentation).

## Prepare your Rails app to run in production

### Configure your Rails app for Jenkins

1. Create a `Jenkinsfile` in your repo with the following content.

    ```
    #!/usr/bin/env groovy

    library("govuk")

    node {
      govuk.buildProject()
    }
    ```

1. Add a Jenkins integration to the repo on GitHub. Find out more about [automatically configuring a GitHub repo][auto-config].

### Add your Rails app to GOV.UK

Find out how to [add your Rails app to GOV.UK using `govuk-puppet`][govuk-puppet].

### Configure your Rails app's deployment

To configure your app's deployment, see the [GOV.UK application deployment scripts][govuk-app-deployment].

### Enable external DNS

If you need to enable external DNS, find out how to [make changes to publishing.service.gov.uk][dns].

### Add your app to the GOV.UK developer documentation

Open a pull request to add your Rails app to the [GOV.UK developer documentation `data/applications.yml` file][docs-applications].

### Ask GOV.UK 2nd line to update Sentry

After you’ve added your Rails app to the GOV.UK developer documentation, [ask GOV.UK 2nd line support](mailto:2nd-line-support@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk) to run the `update-project` task in [GOV.UK SaaS Config][govuk-saas-config] to update Sentry.

### Add your Rails app to Release app

Add your Rails app to the [Release][release] app and select __Create__.

### Run the Deploy_App job

Run the [Deploy_App job][deploy-jenkins].

Use the `with_migrations` option if your Rails app has a database.
