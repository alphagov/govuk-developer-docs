To allow mappings redirecting away from GOV.UK, you'll need to add the site into
a whitelist. This section exists in the Transition tool:
[Redirection whitelist](https://transition.publishing.service.gov.uk/admin/whitelisted_hosts)

You'll need the `admin` permission for Transition to be able to see this page.
