## Whitehall Content Tickets

It's not entirely uncommon in Platform Health to get tickets asking for changes to various bits of information
hosted on Whitehall, for example Prime Minister's biographies, Embassy names etc. The default approach seems
to be to write a data migration, which would normally be correct, however it's often much easier.

If you have access to the [Whitehall admin console](https://whitehall-admin.integration.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/admin) then it's highly likely the item you are looking for is listed under the 'more' tab on the far right.

Items can then be added/edited using a simple form.

The Content Team should have access to this so at this point you can either triage it back to the content team, or quickly do it yourself and inform them that they can do this in the future.
