Sometimes publishers ask us to help them upload very large attachments to
documents in Whitehall because they see timeouts when they try to upload the
document themselves.

The simplest way to do this is to upload a small file and then
[replace the file in Asset Manager](howto-replace-an-assets-file.html).
