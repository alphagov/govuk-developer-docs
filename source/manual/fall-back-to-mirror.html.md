We maintain a static copy of most of the site, which gets used by the content delivery
network (CDN) whenever origin (the application server) times out or serves an error
response.

This process is handled by our CDN config and is entirely transparent to us and
our users. It happens multiple times a day, for lots of different reasons.

This is why we refer to switching off Nginx on the origin cache machines as
"falling back to the mirrors".

## Hosting

GOV.UK is mirrored to two cloud providers:

- Amazon S3: the static mirror is hosted in a bucket `govuk-<environment>-mirror` and the
  content is retrieved by the CDN using an API.  This bucket is replicated to
  `govuk-<environment>-mirror-replica` in another AWS region.

- Google GCS: the static mirror is hosted in a bucket `govuk-<environment>-mirror` and the
  content is retrieved by the CDN using an API.

## Access

Access to the:

1. Amazon S3 buckets are restricted to Fastly, Office and Pingdom IP addresses for read-only access
   and authenticated users in AWS web console.

1. Google GCS buckets are restricted by secret keys in `govuk-secrets` and authenticated users
   in Google GCP web console.

## Updates to the mirror

Every day at 20:00, the [govuk_seed_crawler][] on the Mirrorer machine adds all GOV.UK URLs listed
within the sitemaps (in the magnitude of hundreds of thousands) to a message queue. The [govuk_crawler_worker][]
on the Mirrorer machine consumes these URLs, retrieves the HTML returned by these URLs, saves the content
to disk and adds any new URLs found on those pages to the back of the queue.

Every hour, the static copy of the site is copied from the Mirrorer machine to the primary AWS S3 bucket
`govuk-<environment>-mirror`. This primary bucket is automatically replicated to another S3 bucket
(named `govuk-<environment>-mirror-replica`) in another region by AWS.

In addition, the primary AWS S3 bucket `govuk-<environment>-mirror` is synced to the Google GCS bucket
of the same name daily at 12:00.

The crawler is entirely independent of the mirrors. Stopping the crawler means no new updates are made
to the mirrors, but it will not stop the mirrors from working.

To inspect the contents of the mirror:

```bash
ssh <mirrorer_machine_name>
cd /mnt/crawler_worker/www.gov.uk
```

where `<mirrorer_machine_name>` can be obtained from the `govuk_node_list -c mirrorer` command
on the jumpbox.

## Forcing failover to the static mirrors

Because the CDN will retry every request against the mirrors automatically if origin is unavailable,
[stopping Nginx on the cache machines with Fabric][fab-fail] will result in falling back to mirrors:

```bash
$ fab $environment class:cache incident.fail_to_mirror
```

To disable the fallback:

```bash
$ fab $environment class:cache incident.recover_origin
```

## Emergency publishing using the static mirror

If you need to make changes to the site while origin is unavailable, you'll have to
modify content on the static mirrors. Bear in mind that because the mirror is static
HTML, it's hard to make broad changes to the site (like putting a banner on every page).

You'll be notified by the escalation on-call contact that you need to edit the site.

1. If you're at home, connect to the [VPN][gds-vpn].

1. ssh to the Mirrorer machine by running:

    ```bash
    ssh <mirrorer_machine_name>
    ```

    where `<mirrorer_machine_name>` can be obtained from the `govuk_node_list -c mirrorer` command
    on the jumpbox.

1. Disable puppet on the machine by running:

    ```bash
    govuk_puppet --disable "stopping crawling to avoid mirror changes"
    ```

1. Stop the govuk_crawler_worker by running:

    ```bash
    initctl stop govuk_crawler_worker
    ```

1. Modify the relevant file in the directory `/mnt/crawler_worker`.

1. Upload the file to the AWS S3 bucket via the AWS console.

1. Upload the file to Google Cloud Storage using the GCP
   console.  Credentials are located in the govuk-secrets password store, under `google-accounts`.

If you're notified that the edit you've made can be reverted, do that the same way.

Once origin becomes available again, somebody (maybe you) will have to ensure that
origin has been updated to serve the change that you made.
