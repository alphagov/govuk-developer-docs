[Static mirrors of GOV.UK](/manual/fall-back-to-mirror.html) are hosted in storage buckets within AWS and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). You may need login to GCP to [remove an asset](/manual/howto-manually-remove-assets.html) or to [emergency publish content using the static mirrors](/manual/fall-back-to-mirror.html#emergency-publishing-using-the-static-mirror).

## Request GCP access

Permission to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is managed by RE GOV.UK team. Access to GCP is granted when [permanent Production access](manual/rules-for-getting-production-access.html) is approved and merged to
[GOV.UK user reviewer](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-user-reviewer) repository.

To request GCP access, [raise a Zendesk ticket with Reliability Engineering](https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/manual/raising-issues-with-reliability-engineering.html#raising-a-zendesk-ticket-with-reliability-engineering). Include the user reviewer PR in the ticket body.

You'll be notified when GCP access granted and able to login to [GCP console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) using your `@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk` email address.
