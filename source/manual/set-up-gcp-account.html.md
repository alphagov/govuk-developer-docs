[Static mirrors of GOV.UK](/manual/fall-back-to-mirror.html) are hosted in storage buckets within AWS and Google Cloud Platform (GCP). You may need login to GCP to [remove an asset](/manual/howto-manually-remove-assets.html) or to [emergency publish content using the static mirrors](/manual/fall-back-to-mirror.html#emergency-publishing-using-the-static-mirror).

## Request GCP access

Permission to Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is managed through the [GOV.UK GCP
access Google Group](https://groups.google.com/a/digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/g/govuk-gcp-access).

Access to GCP is granted when [permanent Production access](/manual/rules-for-getting-production-access.html) is
approved and merged to [GOV.UK user reviewer](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-user-reviewer) repository.

If you should have access but don't, the 2nd line team should be able to add
you to the Google Group.

You can login to the GCP console at [https://console.cloud.google.com/](https://console.cloud.google.com/) using
your `@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk` email address.
