[Grafana](https://grafana.com/) is an open-source visualisation tool.
It does not store data, but consumes data sources to create real-time
graphs displayed on custom dashboards. Data sources include Prometheus,
[Graphite], [Logit] and CloudWatch. The query language of the data
store, such as PromQL for Prometheus, is used to construct the graphs.

## Grafana dashboards

- [Production (AWS)](https://grafana.blue.production.govuk.digital)
- [Staging (AWS)](https://grafana.blue.staging.govuk.digital)
- [Integration (AWS)](https://grafana.integration.publishing.service.gov.uk)
- [CI (Carrenza)](https://ci-grafana.integration.publishing.service.gov.uk)

Useful Grafana dashboards:

- [Origin health](https://grafana.publishing.service.gov.uk/dashboard/file/origin_health.json)
- [Edge health](https://grafana.publishing.service.gov.uk/dashboard/file/edge_health.json)
- [Application deployment dashboards](deployment-dashboards.html)

The full list of Grafana dashboards is [stored in the Puppet repo][dashboards].
For details on how to create a new dashboard, read the
[Grafana dashboards alert documentation](/manual/alerts/grafana-dashboards.html).

## Grafana tips

You can use regexes to filter for relevant information. For example,
[`*frontend*` on the processes dashboard](https://grafana.production.govuk.digital/dashboard/file/processes.json?refresh=1m&orgId=1&var-host=All&var-processes=*frontend*&from=now-15m&to=now)
to see all processes that have 'frontend' in them.

We often show multiple metrics on the same graph. The position of the
key shows which Y-axis each metric corresponds to:

You can click on a metric in a graph to show only that metric, or you
can `CMD + click` to select multiple:

Annotations on charts show events such as deploys:
