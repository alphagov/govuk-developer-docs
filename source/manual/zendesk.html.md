2nd line Zendesk tickets are technical errors reported by our users - including government publishers -
and general queries from users of data.gov.uk ("DGU"), for whom 2nd line provides 1st line support.

## Get started

[Create an account][zendesk-create-account], then ask a fellow 2nd liner to assign a new ticket to
`2nd/3rd Line--Zendesk Administration` asking to give you access to `2nd Line--GOV.UK Alerts and Issues`.

When you're logged in, you should be looking at the [`2nd Line--GOV.UK Alerts and Issues` queue][zendesk-queue].

## Priorities

Work on 'High' priority tickets first - these will have been triaged by 2nd line already, so should be
relevant and actionable - and start with the oldest by date. If external assistance from outside 2nd
line is required, assign them on the ticket and move on to the next ticket (keeping the ticket in the
2nd line queue).

Ignore 'Low' priority tickets - these have been triaged by 2nd line for GOV.UK product managers to review.

New tickets are 'Normal' priority by default and require triaging (i.e. a developer reading and categorising
it).

## Triaging a ticket

If you have any doubts as to the legitimacy or urgency of a ticket, it should be deferred to the delivery manager.

Once you've established that a ticket is legitimate, you should follow [the process in this diagram][zendesk-triage-diagram].
There is a printout on the 2nd line desk.

In all cases, 2nd line will respond to the ticket, even if it is simply a note to the user saying that
you've passed their request to the relevent team.

### Service Level Agreements

GOV.UK have committed to a minimum service level agreement for 2nd line support.

* 80% of tickets get a first reply to the ticket within 2 working days
* 80% of general enquiries (public tickets) resolved within 5 working days
* 70% of department tickets are closed within 5 working days

If the volume of Zendesk tickets is overwhelming, talk to the delivery manager or a senior tech member
for assistance.

## Picking up a ticket

Click the "take it" link under "Assignee", followed by "Submit as Open", to formally undertake a ticket.
If you know you cannot solve a ticket immediately, fill in a "Public reply" to the requester to let them
know you’re looking into it.

Read [Common 2nd line support tasks for data.gov.uk](/manual/data-gov-uk-2nd-line.html), which outlines
some of the common DGU tickets that come in and how to fix them.

You can use Internal Notes to keep a log of actions you've taken so far: this can make it easier for other
staff to pick up where you left off if you're unable to solve the ticket yourself. Please note that departments
can see internal notes, so don’t write anything you wouldn’t say to someone publicly.

If you need more information from the user, or confirmation that everything is now working as expected, fill
in the "Public reply" as appropriate and click "Submit as Pending".

## Closing a ticket

Once you've resolved a ticket, click "Submit as Solved".

## Tickets left pending without a response

Note that if a ticket has been resolved and pending a response for 5 or more days with no response from the
requester, you can submit it as solved with a message telling them why and that if they still need help they
can get in touch. Do this by clicking the "Apply macro" button at the bottom of the ticket screen, and
choosing the "GOV.UK 2nd line tech: pending for 5+ days" option.
