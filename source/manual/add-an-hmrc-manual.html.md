HMRC publish their own manuals on GOV.UK using the HMRC Manuals API, but new manuals can only be added once we have manually allowed the slug for the manual. When a ticket comes in to Zendesk asking for an HMRC manual to be published, it just means that we need to [add a new slug], which they will provide.
