## Change a government in Whitehall

Following a General Election or other reason for governmental change the
current Government in Whitehall will need to be closed, and a new one created.

The Content Support team will normally be the ones who close the government and
re-assign ministers once a new government has been opened. However, a developer
will often be required to monitor the queues, as detailed below.

### Closing a government

Governments are listed at the [government path of Whitehall Admin][].

[government path of Whitehall Admin]: https://whitehall-admin.integration.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/admin/governments

1. Select the current government, and click the `Prepare to close this
   government` link.
2. Close the government.

This will close the current government and remove all [ministerial
appointments][].

This will cause a high number of documents to be represented by the Publishing
API which might mean some delays on content being up to date on the website.
Previous tests have shown that it takes around 3.5 hours for the queues to
clear in integration.

### Open a new government

[Create a new government](https://whitehall-admin.integration.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/admin/governments/new)

This will instantly create a new government. Changes can be seen in the Rails
console by running `Government.current`.

The new government should also instantly appear in the response from
[/api/governments][].

[/api/governments]: https://www.integration.publishing.service.gov.uk/api/governments

### Applying a banner to political content published by the previous government

Content in Whitehall can be marked as political. Political content which was
published under a previous government is [`historic?`][historic]. This is
highlighted on the page, and in search results. This feature is also known as
_history mode_.

See these pages for example:

[A content page](https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/the-issuing-withdrawal-or-refusal-of-passports)
[A search results page](https://www.gov.uk/search/all?keywords=The+issuing%2C+withdrawal+or+refusal+of+passports&order=relevance)

[historic]: https://github.com/alphagov/whitehall/blob/e518218355d158bfff036a02e312dda714da0aa6/app/models/edition.rb#L647

Marking content as political can happen automatically through the
[PoliticalContentIdentifier][]. The `political` flag on an `Edition` can also
be set manually.

[PoliticalContentIdentifier]: https://github.com/alphagov/whitehall/blob/main/lib/political_content_identifier.rb

#### Reindexing political content in search

There is a Rake task to reindex all political content in search. This must be
done after a government is closed.

<%= RunRakeTask.links("whitehall-admin", "search:political") %>

### Backdating

If we need to backdate a government or split a single government into two
distinct dates, we need to run a rake task to republish all political content
from Whitehall to properly associate content with the government at it's first
published date:

<%= RunRakeTask.links("whitehall-admin", "election:republish_political_content") %>

### Ending ministerial roles without closing a government

If we need to end all ministerial roles without explicitly closing a government,
we can run a rake task:

<%= RunRakeTask.links("whitehall-admin", "election:end_ministerial_appointments") %>

This will end all ministerial roles except the Prime Minister. You might have to
do that one manually.

## Machinery of Government Changes

Following machinery of government changes, developers can help content
designers make bulk changes to documents and users.

### Bulk changing users

There is a Rake task in Signon to change the organisation that a user belongs
to in bulk:
[`data_hygiene:bulk_update_organisation[csv_file]`][signon-bulk-update-organisation].

It accepts a CSV file which should have at least the following columns (in any
order):

| Column Header | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Old email` | The old email address of the user. |
| `New email` | The new email address of the user. |
| `New organisation` | The slug of the new organisations for the user. |

**Note:** It may be necessary to leave the old users around so they can still
edit content for the old organisation. In that case you can bulk invite new
users [using the interface in Signon][signon-batch-invitations].

[signon-bulk-update-organisation]: https://github.com/alphagov/signon/blob/256ede9caa6061fd68b1daffd7123fff49df679f/lib/tasks/data_hygiene.rake#L3
[signon-batch-invitations]: https://signon.publishing.service.gov.uk/batch_invitations/new

### Bulk retagging documents

There is a Rake task in Whitehall to change the lead and supporting
organisations that a document is tagged to in bulk:
[`data_hygiene:bulk_update_organisation[csv_file]`][whitehall-bulk-update-organisation].

It accepts a CSV file which should have at least the following columns (in any
order):

| Column Header | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Slug` | The slug of the document. |
| `Document type` | The type of the document, for example `DetailedGuide`. This is used when more than one document is matched by the `Slug`. |
| `New lead organisations` | The slugs of the new leading organisations (separated by a comma). These will replace any existing organisations. |
| `New supporting organisations` | The slugs of the new supporting organisations (separated by a comma). These will replace any existing organisations. |

To run on anything other than a local environment, the CSV needs to be added manually to the /tmp directory using scp-push.
```
$ gds govuk connect scp-push --environment [integration|staging|integration] name-of-machine[:1|:2|:3] path/to/file.csv /tmp/
```
The rake task can then be run from the command line following [these instructions][running-rake-tasks-on-the-command-line].

There is a similar [Rake task to change the organisations for Manuals][manuals-bulk-update-organisation].
A data migration is required to change the organisations for (Mainstream) Publisher documents. This is an example PR: [Migrate Publisher docs][publisher-bulk-update-organisation-example]

### Reorder ministers/peoples role titles

During a reshuffle, a minister can gain two positions of state, known as `RoleAppointments`
in Whitehall. One of these is perceived to be a more senior role than the other.

To reorder a minister or persons titles, visit the following URL, replacing `<person-name>` with the hyphenated name of the person:

```
https://whitehall-admin.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/admin/people/<person-name>/reorder_role_appointments
```

For example, for Rishi Sunak it would be:

```
https://whitehall-admin.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/admin/people/rishi-sunak/reorder_role_appointments
```
