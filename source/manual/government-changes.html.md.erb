## Change a government in Whitehall

Following a General Election or other reason for governmental change the
current Government in Whitehall will need to be closed, and a new one created.

The Content Support team will normally be the ones who close the government and
re-assign ministers once a new government has been opened. However, a developer
will often be required to monitor the queues, as detailed below.

### Closing a government

Governments are listed at the [government path of Whitehall Admin][].

[government path of Whitehall Admin]: https://whitehall-admin.integration.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/admin/governments

1. Select the current government, and click the `Prepare to close this
   government` link.
2. Close the government - note that this may take some time, be patient after clicking the button

This will close the current government and remove all [ministerial
appointments][].

This will cause a high number of documents to be represented by the Publishing
API which might mean some delays on content being up to date on the website.
Previous tests have shown that it takes around 3.5 hours for the queues to
clear in integration / staging.

Grafana monitoring for the Publishing API queues:

- [Integration](https://grafana.eks.integration.govuk.digital/d/sidekiq-queues/sidekiq3a-queue-length-max-delay?orgId=1&var-namespace=apps&var-app=publishing-api-worker)
- [Staging](https://grafana.eks.staging.govuk.digital/d/sidekiq-queues/sidekiq3a-queue-length-max-delay?orgId=1&var-namespace=apps&var-app=publishing-api-worker)
- [Production](https://grafana.eks.production.govuk.digital/d/sidekiq-queues/sidekiq3a-queue-length-max-delay?orgId=1&var-namespace=apps&var-app=publishing-api-worker)

#### Reindexing political content in search

There is a Rake task to reindex all political content in search. This must be
done after a government is closed, but can be done before the publishing-api queues
have completed their processing.

This is necessary because [search is populated by whitehall][], which is a piece of technical debt.

<%= RunRakeTask.links("whitehall-admin", "search:political") %>

[search is populated by whitehall]: https://trello.com/c/vnrBGTvr/26-search-is-populated-by-whitehall-sending-data?filter=search

### Open a new government

[Create a new government](https://whitehall-admin.integration.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/admin/governments/new)

This will instantly create a new government. Changes can be seen in the Rails
console by running `Government.current`.

### Applying a banner to political content published by the previous government

Content in Whitehall can be marked as political, either automatically on publishing
(if deemed political by the [PoliticalContentIdentifier][]), or manually post-publication
(through checking the "Political?" checkbox). Political content which was published under
a previous government is [`historic?`][historic], and is highlighted both on the page and
in search results - see examples:

- [A content page](https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/the-issuing-withdrawal-or-refusal-of-passports)
- [A search results page](https://www.gov.uk/search/all?keywords=The+issuing%2C+withdrawal+or+refusal+of+passports&order=relevance)

This feature is also known as [history mode][].

[historic]: https://github.com/alphagov/whitehall/blob/e518218355d158bfff036a02e312dda714da0aa6/app/models/edition.rb#L647
[history mode]: /repos/whitehall/history_mode.html
[PoliticalContentIdentifier]: https://github.com/alphagov/whitehall/blob/main/lib/political_content_identifier.rb

### Backdating

If we need to backdate a government or split a single government into two
distinct dates, we need to run a rake task to republish all political content
from Whitehall to properly associate content with the government at its first
published date:

<%= RunRakeTask.links("whitehall-admin", "election:republish_political_content") %>

### Ending ministerial roles without closing a government

If we need to end all ministerial roles without explicitly closing a government,
we can run a rake task:

<%= RunRakeTask.links("whitehall-admin", "election:end_ministerial_appointments") %>

This will end all ministerial roles except the Prime Minister. You might have to
do that one manually. Note that the rake task takes an optional date parameter,
if you wish to specify an end date other than 'today'.

## Machinery of Government Changes

Following machinery of government changes, developers can help content
designers make bulk changes to documents and users.

### Bulk changing users

There is a Rake task in Signon to change the organisation that a user belongs
to in bulk. **However**, it may be necessary to leave the old users around so they
can still edit content for the old organisation (in which case you can bulk invite
new users [using the interface in Signon][signon-batch-invitations]).

The rake task for changing the organisation the user belongs to is:

[`data_hygiene:bulk_update_organisation[csv_file]`][signon-bulk-update-organisation].

It accepts a CSV file which should have at least the following columns (in any
order):

| Column Header | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Old email` | The old email address of the user. |
| `New email` | The new email address of the user. |
| `New organisation` | The slug of the new organisations for the user. |

We should phase out CSV-reliant rake tasks now that we're on Kubernetes.
In the meantime, follow the [working with CSVs on Kubernetes][running-csv-rake-tasks] instructions.

[signon-bulk-update-organisation]: https://github.com/alphagov/signon/blob/256ede9caa6061fd68b1daffd7123fff49df679f/lib/tasks/data_hygiene.rake#L3
[signon-batch-invitations]: https://signon.publishing.service.gov.uk/batch_invitations/new

### Bulk retagging documents

There is a Rake task in Whitehall to change the lead and supporting
organisations that a document is tagged to in bulk:
[`data_hygiene:bulk_update_organisation[csv_file]`][whitehall-bulk-update-organisation].

It accepts a CSV file which should have at least the following columns (in any
order):

| Column Header | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Slug` | The slug of the document. |
| `Document type` | The type of the document, for example `DetailedGuide`. This is used when more than one document is matched by the `Slug`. |
| `New lead organisations` | The slugs of the new leading organisations (separated by a comma). These will replace any existing organisations. |
| `New supporting organisations` | The slugs of the new supporting organisations (separated by a comma). These will replace any existing organisations. |

We should phase out CSV-reliant rake tasks now that we're on Kubernetes.
In the meantime, follow the [working with CSVs on Kubernetes][running-csv-rake-tasks] instructions.

In Publishing Api, the task responsible for retagging documents is
[`data_hygiene:bulk_update_organisation[csv_file]`][publishing-api-bulk-update-organisation].
It accepts a CSV file listing the document's slug and new associated organisations:

| Column Header | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `path` | The slug of the document. |
| `all organisations` | The slugs of the new organisations (separated by a comma). These will replace any existing organisations. |

There is a similar [Rake task to change the organisations for Manuals][manuals-bulk-update-organisation].
A data migration is required to change the organisations for (Mainstream) Publisher documents.
This is an example PR: [Migrate Publisher docs][publisher-bulk-update-organisation-example]

### Reorder ministers/peoples role titles

During a reshuffle, a minister can gain two positions of state, known as `RoleAppointments`
in Whitehall. One of these is perceived to be a more senior role than the other.

To reorder a minister or persons titles, visit the following URL, replacing `<person-name>` with the hyphenated name of the person:

```
https://whitehall-admin.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/admin/people/<person-name>/reorder_role_appointments
```

For example, for Rishi Sunak it would be:

```
https://whitehall-admin.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/admin/people/rishi-sunak/reorder_role_appointments
```
