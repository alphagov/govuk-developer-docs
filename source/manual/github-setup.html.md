1. Set up a [GitHub][] account. Existing personal accounts are fine to use.
1. Ask your tech lead to add you to the [alphagov organisation][alphagov]. You will have to be added to the [GOV.UK team][govuk-team] to get access to repos & CI. Remember to click accept in the GitHub email invitation.
1. Ask somebody with access to add your GitHub username to the [user monitoring system][user-reviewer].
1. [Generate and register an SSH key pair][register-ssh-key] for your laptop for your GitHub account. You should use a `4096` bit key.
1. Import the SSH key into your keychain. Once youâ€™ve done this, you'll be able to clone repos over SSH.

    ```
    $ /usr/bin/ssh-add -K your-private-key
    ```

1. Add the above line into your `~/.bash_profile` or equivalent so that it is persistent between restarts.
    
1. Test that it all works by running `ssh -T git@github.com`.

1. While you're here, associate your name and email to your git commits:

    ```
    $ git config --global user.email "friendly.giraffe@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk"
    $ git config --global user.name "Friendly Giraffe"
    ```
