We're [obliged to keep our software current][current].

To help with this, we use a service called [Dependabot][] to perform automated dependency upgrades.

## Add Dependabot to a repo

1. Give Dependabot [access to the repo][access] (only GitHub org owners can do this)
1. Go to [Dependabot admin][admin] and click "Add project"

## Ask Dependabot to bump dependencies

By default Dependabot will bump dependencies once a day, but you can ask it to bump manually:

Go to [Dependabot admin][admin] and click "Bump now" for your project

## Audit Dependabot PRs

We have the [govuk-dependencies app][app] to monitor outstanding Dependabot PRs on govuk repos.

## Security

There are 2 safeguards to prevent unauthorised code changes. Firstly, Dependabot can only update the repositories that we [explicitly allow on GitHub][access]. This prevents code changes to other repos. Secondly, we've [set up branch protection](/manual/configure-github-repo.html#auto-configuration) for all repos with the `govuk` label. This prevents Dependabot from writing directly to master.
