Callbacks from Notify may fail and require us to manually query the status of
emails.

There are two rake tasks that can do this using either the `reference` or the
`email_id`

## Query the Notify API for email(s) by reference

[⚙ Run rake task on production][reference]


## Query the Notify API for email(s) by email ID

[⚙ Run rake task on production][email_id]

Example output when a notification is found:

```
Query Notify for emails with the reference ref_123
-------------------------------------------
Notification ID: f163deaf-2d3f-4ec6-98fc-f23fa511518f
Status: delivered
created_at: 2019-01-29 11:12:30 UTC
sent_at: 2019-01-29 11:12:40 UTC
completed_at: 2019-01-29 11:12:52 UTC
```

Example output when a notification is not found:

```
Query Notify for emails with the reference PPP
No results found, empty collection returned
```

Example output when the request fails:

```
Query Notify for emails with the reference ref_123
Returns request error 400, message: [{"error"=>"ValidationError",
"message"=>"bad status is not one of [created, sending, sent,
delivered, pending, failed, technical-failure, temporary-failure,
permanent-failure, accepted, received]"}]
```
