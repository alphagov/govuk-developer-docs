Teams are responsible for deploying their own work. We believe that [regular releases minimise the risk of major problems][reg] and improve recovery time. The [2nd line team][2l] is responsible for providing access to deploy software for teams who can't deploy it themselves.

If you are responding to a security incident, follow the steps to [deploy fixes for a security vulnerability][sec].

## 1. Test on integration

Code that is merged to `master` is automatically deployed to integration. You should verify that your changes work there.

## 2. Check the context

The golden rule is that you only deploy what you can support.

- This means that deployments generally take place between 9.30am and 5pm (4pm on Fridays), the core hours when most people are in the office.
- Check `#govuk-deploy` recent history and the channel topic. In some circumstances we may institute short deployment freezes, and they will be announced in that channel as well as other developer-relevant channels and possibly email.
- Announce your deployment in `#govuk-2ndline` if itâ€™s potentially problematic, or in `#govuk-deploy` if it involves deploying something other than a release tag (like a branch).

## 3. Check your changes

Go to the [Release application](https://release.publishing.service.gov.uk) and find the application you want to deploy. Then select the release tag you want to deploy.

- Check what you will be deploying. If there's other people's code to deploy, ask them whether they're okay for the changes to go out.
- Check if there's a deploy note for the application, to see if there are any special instructions or reasons not to deploy. Individual app deploy freezes are usually announced here.
- Check in `#govuk-deploy` if someone's already in the process of deploying the app. This is particularly important for Puppet where there is a delay of 30 minutes between staging and production deployments. Deployments attributed to "Jenkins" are AWS automated deployments and can be ignored for this purpose.

## 4. Deploy to staging

From the [Release application](https://release.publishing.service.gov.uk), click the deploy buttons. If you have production access, this will bring you to the Jenkins job to deploy your change.

Once deployed to staging, you will need to:

- Perform manual testing (including any testing mandated as part of the deploy note for the app)
- [Monitor your app during deployment](/manual/deployment-dashboards.html)
- Check the results of the [smoke tests](https://github.com/alphagov/smokey)
- Keep an eye on any Icinga alerts related to your application
- Check Sentry for any new errors

## 5. Deploy to production

Again:

- Perform manual testing (including any testing mandated as part of the deploy note for the app)
- [Monitor your app during deployment](/manual/deployment-dashboards.html)
- Check the results of the [smoke tests](https://github.com/alphagov/smokey)
- Keep an eye on any Icinga alerts related to your application
- Check Sentry for any new errors

Stay around for a while just in case something goes wrong.
