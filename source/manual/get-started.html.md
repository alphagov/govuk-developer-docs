## 1. Set up your GitHub account

👉 [Set up your GitHub account](/manual/github-setup.html)

## 2. Set up govuk-docker

The easiest way to develop on GOV.UK is to use [govuk-docker][]. Until July 2019 we used a [GOV.UK Vagrant development VM](/manual/install-development-vm.html), but this is now deprecated.

## 3. Get SSH access to integration
