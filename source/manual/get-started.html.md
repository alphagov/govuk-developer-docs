This is the guide for new technical staff working on GOV.UK in [GDS][]. If you just joined, 👋 welcome!

If they haven't done so yet, ask your tech lead to take you through the [overview slides][overview-slides].

If you're having trouble with this guide, you can ask your colleagues or the #govuk-developers channel in Slack.

## 1. Set up your GitHub account

👉 [Set up your GitHub account](/manual/github-setup.html)

## 2. Set up govuk-docker

The easiest way to develop on GOV.UK is to use [govuk-docker][]. Until July 2019 we used a [GOV.UK Vagrant development VM](/manual/install-development-vm.html), but this is now deprecated.

👉 [See the govuk-docker README][govuk-docker]

## 3. Get AWS access

👉 First, [set up your AWS account](/manual/set-up-aws-account.html)

👉 Then, [set up your CLI access for AWS](/manual/aws-cli-access.html)
