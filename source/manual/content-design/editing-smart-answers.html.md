[smart answer][smart-answers-github] they will need the appropriate
[GitHub access](./github-access.html).

If it is your first time working with GitHub it's useful to familiarise
yourself with the [GitHub flow](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flow/)
and be comfortable with concepts such as branches, pull requests and merging.
