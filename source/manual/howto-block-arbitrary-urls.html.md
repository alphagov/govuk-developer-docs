During a recent security incident it became necessary to block a GOV.UK
section in order to prevent access to sensitive data.

A quick way to achieve this is to manually add a `location` block to the NGINX
configuration on the cache machines or instances serving the affected pages.

In order to block `<LEAK_URL>` on `<INSTANCE_CLASS>` in `<GOVUK_ENVIRONMENT>`:

1. Find out which `<INSTANCE_CLASS>` serves `<LEAK_URL>`.

   - For GOV.UK content, this can be done via the content-api: `https://www.gov.uk/api/content/<LEAK_URL>` or by using the
   [GOV.UK browser extension](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-browser-extension).
   - For external/independent applications, e.g. CKAN, you may need to consult the respective routing table to find out from which machine the content is served.
   - Another option to determine which machine class runs an app is to consult the [GOV.UK architecture overview](https://drive.google.com/a/digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/file/d/1-O5XIIeDK-Mos_thA_hQODBQ6sYnToWs/view?usp=sharing).

1. [Disable Puppet on each machine](/manual/howto-run-ssh-commands-on-many-machines.html#disable-puppet) of the respective `<INSTANCE_CLASS>`

1. Edit `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` on each machine of the `<INSTANCE_CLASS>` to add a location block
   to the server block, forcing to return `403 FORBIDDEN`, e.g.

   ```
   server {
   (...)
     location /<LEAK_URL>/ {
       return 403;
     }
   }
   ```

   Location blocks are not limited to absolute paths, but can also include regular expressions if prefixed by the `~` operator.
   See the additional external documentation [here][Digital ocean] and [here][Linode] for examples.

   > take extra care to not accidentally block unaffected pages as a side effect.

1. Test the NGINX configuration by running `sudo service nginx configtest` [on each machine](/manual/howto-run-ssh-commands-on-many-machines.html#loop-over-the-machines)

   If the configuration test is successful, e.g. returns `out: nginx: configuration file /etc/nginx/nginx.conf test is successful`

1. Reload the NGINX configuration by running `sudo service nginx restart` [on each machine](/manual/howto-run-ssh-commands-on-many-machines.html#loop-over-the-machines)

1. To make sure the change of configuration was successful, try to browse `https://www.gov.uk/<LEAK_URL>`

1. To make the change permanent there are different options, ranging from additional vhost configuration inline in the respective
   Puppet class of the app ([example PR](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-puppet/pull/9447))
   or introduce a separate NGINX configuration template for the app if more complex
   changes are required ([example PR](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-puppet/pull/9485)).
   Alternatively, changes to the app may remove the offending content.

1. Finally, [re-enable Puppet on each machine](/manual/howto-run-ssh-commands-on-many-machines.html#enable-puppet) of the `<INSTANCE_CLASS>`
