All front-end traffic and back-end publisher traffic is now on Kubernetes (EKS) instead of EC2 (see [status update doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BzPqMT57zXg6wL5D7vYTmKu85T4ZuDcaw5twOGPP1p0/edit "‚Äå") and [runbook](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TusO_GJ5Ustte6RnZ6LIwZ8N4ZILidQ77taTClbaPB8/edit "‚Äå")). üéâ Also useful to bookmark this document describing [what stays/goes/changes with Replatforming](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R8C3BtvhqTXEga4C3_KxTopjWuYVbiEgKiikTyRXXiA/edit "‚Äå"), and the [GOV.UK Kubernetes docs](https://govuk-k8s-user-docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/ "‚Äå").

Things we used to do on EC2 now need to be done differently on EKS.

## Deployments

- You can still use the [Release](https://release.publishing.service.gov.uk/applications "‚Äå") app to see what is deployed where. NB, release tags are going away, but will still be created for as long as we auto-deploy to both EKS and EC2.
- Continuously deployed apps will continue to be deployed post-merge, using [ArgoCD](https://argo.eks.integration.govuk.digital/applications "‚Äå"). You can see the progress of a workflow in [Argo Workflows](https://argo-workflows.eks.integration.govuk.digital/workflows/apps?limit=50 "‚Äå")
- Non-continuously deployed apps can be manually deployed by:
    - Go to the app‚Äôs repo in GitHub, then choose Actions, then Deploy (from the left-hand column).
    - Click ‚ÄúRun workflow‚Äù and enter the default branch name (usually `main`) under "Commit, tag or branch name to deploy". (Always leave the "Use workflow from" option set as `main`, unless you‚Äôre actually trying to change the workflow itself.)
- To deploy a branch, follow the manual deploy steps above, providing the branch name in "Commit, tag or branch name to deploy".
- DNS rollouts are still via Jenkins for now (so no change, e.g. `gds govuk dns -r govuk-production-admin -z service.gov.uk -a plan -p aws`)
- Fastly CDN config rollouts are also still via Jenkins for now.

## Deploy a branch to integration

1. Go here: [https://github.com/alphagov/frontend/actions/workflows/deploy.yml](https://github.com/alphagov/frontend/actions/workflows/deploy.yml)
2. Click ‚ÄúRun workflow‚Äù
3. Leave, ‚Äúuse workflow‚Äù as ‚Äúmain‚Äù, then enter the branch name and environment details

## Smokey results

Smokey results persist for longer only if they have failed.

## Interacting with apps

The following commands assume you have `alias k=kubectl` as per the [https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/cheatsheet/ "smartCard-inline") .

## Run a rake task

[Run a Rake task on EKS](https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/manual/running-rake-tasks.html#run-a-rake-task-on-eks "‚Äå")

### Other tasks

- To open a rails console:
    - `k -n apps exec -it deploy/router-api -- rails c`
- To open a shell:
    - `k -n apps exec -it deploy/government-frontend -- bash`
      \>> `curl` # (for example)
- To open a shell on Router:
    - `k -n apps exec -it deploy/router -c nginx`

Note that you can omit the `-n apps` bit of the above commands if you specify a default namespace (recommended), by:

- `k config set-context --current --namespace=apps`

#### Testing changes to a rake task.

For special router publisher as an example:

1. Deploy your branch (see above)
2. Run the following command(s):

```
BASE_PATH=whatever

kubectl run -n apps --image 172025368201.dkr.ecr.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/special-route-publisher special-route-publisher -- rake "publish_one_special_route[${BASE_PATH?}]"

kubectl logs -fnapps special-route-publisher

kubectl -napps delete po/special-route-publisher

```

There‚Äôs also a [command in the PR](https://github.com/alphagov/special-route-publisher/pull/257) that might work.

## Dashboards and alerting

- The detailed Sidekiq dashboard is not yet available for EKS (the [old one](https://sidekiq-monitoring.integration.govuk.digital/publishing-api/queues "‚Äå") still looks at EC2) but you can see queue lengths and age-of-oldest-job on the [Sidekiq Grafana dashboard](https://grafana.eks.production.govuk.digital/d/2Yy8PzmVk "‚Äå").
- Dashboards are on [https://grafana.eks.production.govuk.digital/](https://grafana.eks.production.govuk.digital/?orgId=1 "‚Äå") and no longer require VPN. Don‚Äôt get confused by the [old Grafana](https://grafana.production.govuk.digital/ "‚Äå"), which will show mostly empty graphs about the old EC2 setup.
- Most Icinga alerts are irrelevant now, except for:
    - ‚Äúscheduled publications in Whitehall not queued‚Äù / ‚Äúoverdue publications in Whitehall‚Äù
    - ‚ÄúTravel Advice email alert check‚Äù / ‚ÄúMedical Safety Email alert check‚Äù
    - Anything to do with crawler/mirrors
    - Anything to do with Licensify
