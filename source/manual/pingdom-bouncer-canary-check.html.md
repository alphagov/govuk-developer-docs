# Pingdom Bouncer canary check

Bouncer has a canary route at <https://www.direct.gov.uk/__canary__>
which queries all the database tables which Bouncer uses to serve all
responses to users and checks that those tables are not empty. The
canary should return 200; if it doesn't then errors will be being served
to users - see the table below for more details of the errors in each
case.

The application page for Bouncer and Transition [documents Bouncer's
stack](applications/bouncer-and-transition.html#bouncer-s-stack).

Possible causes of errors on the canary route include:

-   DNS problems for `www.direct.gov.uk` or
    `bouncer.publishing.service.gov.uk` - check [Bouncer's nginx
    logs](https://kibana.publishing.service.gov.uk/kibana/#/dashboard/elasticsearch/Bouncer)
    to see which requests are getting through
-   CDN problems resulting in requests for `www.direct.gov.uk` not being
    correctly passed to `https://bouncer.publishing.service.gov.uk`
-   `bouncer-*` or `transition-postgresql-slave-1` machines being
    unavailable
-   Bouncer's dependencies being missing or having errors in its
    configuration
-   [memory](https://graphite.publishing.service.gov.uk/render/?width=600&height=300&target=alias(dashed(constantLine(6442450944)),%22critical%22)&target=alias(dashed(constantLine(4294967296)),%22warning%22)&target=bouncer-*_redirector.processes-app-bouncer.ps_rss&from=-2days)
    leaks in Bouncer
-   the app being unable to connect or authorise to the database
-   the database or the required tables being missing or empty
-   the `bouncer` role not having `SELECT` privileges on the required
    tables

The database tables checked by the canary route (in order) and the
effect on requests for transitioned sites of errors when querying them:

  Database table          HTTP status codes for requests for transitioned sites
  ----------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  table name              when table inaccessible when table missing data
  =====================   ================================================================================================ ==========================
  `hosts`                 `500` for all requests `404` for all requests
  `sites`                 `500` for all requests `500` for all requests
  `mappings`              `500` for most requests `404` for most requests
  `whitelisted_hosts`     `500` for requests which should redirect to non-`*.gov.uk`/`*.mod.uk`/`*.nhs.uk` domains `501` for those requests
  `organisations`         `500` for most requests which should serve a 404 or 410 page `500` for those requests

There are other tables in the `transition_production` database but they
are only used by Transition and not by Bouncer.
