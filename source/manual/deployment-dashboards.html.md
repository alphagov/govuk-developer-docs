## Deployment Dashboards

There are a number of applications with a dashboard showing useful information for the deployment process.

They can be found in [Grafana](tools.html#grafana), and they are all named "Application dashboard - application name", such as [Application dashboard - Whitehall][whitehall-dashboard].

The existing deployment dashboards are written by Puppet every 30 minutes and loaded when Grafana starts. Donâ€™t change them directly.

You can also see further tips on [how we use Graphite][graphite-dashboards] to present the data below.

## Deploy the Dashboards

Please refer to [add a deployment dashboard][add-dashboard] for details on adding or updating dashboards.
