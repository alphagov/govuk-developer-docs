## Deployment Dashboards

There are a number of applications with a dashboard showing useful information for the deployment process.

They can be found in [Grafana](tools.html#grafana), and they are all named "Application dashboard - application name", such as [Application dashboard - Whitehall][whitehall-dashboard].

The existing deployment dashboards are written by Puppet every 30 minutes and loaded when Grafana starts. Don’t change them directly.

You can also see further tips on [how we use Graphite][graphite-dashboards] to present the data below.

## Change the Dashboards

Each dashboard panel is configured by a .json.erb template in [Puppet][application_dashboard_panels] and these are combined to generate the JSON config for each application dashboard.

You can export the entire dashboard by clicking on the cog:

![Dashboard JSON](images/deployment_dashboards/view_json.png)

Or you can export a single panel by clicking on the panel title to add it to a partial:

![Panel JSON](images/deployment_dashboards/panel_json.png)

Please delete any temporary dashboards after you’ve finished.

### If you’re adding a new panel

Create a new partial in Puppet with the exported JSON
Replace any application specific text/urls/queries in the partial with template variables.

`govuk-puppet` uses an [array structure](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-puppet/blob/master/modules/grafana/manifests/dashboards.pp) to dynamically control which partials are rendered.

Adding your partial name to this structure will result in it being rendered in Grafana.

## Add a new application

The list of applications that have dashboards generated is stored in the [hiera data](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-puppet/blob/master/hieradata/common.yaml) inside Puppet under `grafana::dashboards::deployment_applications`.

Each dashboard can have parameters associated with it which affect how the dashboard is generated.

Parameters:

- `has_workers`: Adds a row with worker failure and success panels. This is required for applications that have Sidekiq workers. Defaults to `false`.

- `show_controller_errors`: Adds a row which graphs 5XX responses broken down by Rails controller and action. For this graph to contain data, the application must report response statuses to Kibana as `status`, and also report the controller and action as `controller` and `action`. You may wish to set this to `false` for apps with very low request rates to avoid having an empty and potentially confusing graph. Defaults to `true`.

- `show_slow_requests`: Adds a row which graphs response times broken down by Rails controller. For this graph to contain data, the application must report response times to Kibana as `duration` and the controller as `controller`. You may wish to set this to `false` for apps with very low request rates to avoid having an empty and potentially confusing graph. Defaults to `true`.

- `docs_name`: This is the name of the application used in the developer documentation. Often the same as the repository name on GitHub. This defaults to the `app_name`.

- `error_threshold`: The threshold at which application errors are highlighted in red. Defaults to 50.

- `warning_threshold`: The threshold at which application errors are highlighted in orange. Defaults to 25.
