[Sidekiq monitoring
applications](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/wiki/Monitoring) are
Sinatra applications that ship with the [Sidekiq
gem](http://sidekiq.org/). We have configured these to run as
[Standalone](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/wiki/Monitoring#standalone)
apps on our backend machines.

## Prerequisites

-   Identify a port you want to allocate to the sidekiq-monitoring
    instance for your application and reserve it in
    [development-vm/Procfile](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-puppet/blob/master/development-vm/Procfile).

## Adding configuration for your application in sidekiq-monitoring repository

-   Add a line to the Procfile with the port you reserved earlier in the
    [sidekiq-monitoring
    repository](https://github.com/alphagov/sidekiq-monitoring)
    maintaining the alphabetical order of the processes.
-   Update
    [index.html](https://github.com/alphagov/sidekiq-monitoring/blob/master/public/index.html#L26-L29)
    to include a link to your application's sidekiq-monitoring
    maintaining the alphabetical order of the applications. This path is
    configured as a location under the sidekiq-monitoring vhost.
-   Run `bundle exec foreman start` and test that your Rack and Redis
    config work as expected.

## Configuring infrastructure

Add your application to the [govuk::apps::sidekiq\_monitoring
module](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-puppet/blob/master/modules/govuk/manifests/apps/sidekiq_monitoring.pp)
in Puppet cross referencing the [Redis
configuration](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-puppet/commit/9ffa90f571a43cba1e341c359111bf18db9cde1a).

## Configuring a path under the sidekiq-monitoring vhost

The sidekiq-monitoring vhost in nginx has one location for every
sidekiq-monitoring application. Add one for your application in [this
puppet
template](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-puppet/blob/70a10190b/modules/govuk/templates/sidekiq_monitoring_nginx_config.conf.erb#L21-L23).

## Test that the configuration works on Integration

Once changes are merged and deployed to Integration, you can
access your [sidekiq monitoring](monitor-sidekiq-workers.html) instance running on Integration, and check that it works as expected.
