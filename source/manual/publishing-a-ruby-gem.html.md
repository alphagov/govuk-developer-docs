## Conventions

For conventions around naming, refer to the [RubyGems naming guide][] and the
[GOV.UK naming policy][].

Follow [Semantic Versioning][] and put version updates in their own commit.

Follow the file and directory [conventions used by Bundler][].

## Releasing gem versions

Use GitHub Actions for releasing gems, with our [shared publish workflow][] and the
`ALPHAGOV_RUBYGEMS_API_KEY` secret. For builds with extra needs (e.g. the npm
build step in govuk_publishing_components), copy and adapt the shared workflow.

Contact a [GOV.UK GitHub Owner][] to grant your repository
[access to the secret][].

[shared publish workflow]: https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-infrastructure/blob/main/.github/workflows/publish-rubygem.yml
[GOV.UK GitHub Owner]: mailto:govuk-github-owners@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk
[access to the secret]: https://github.com/organizations/alphagov/settings/secrets/actions

## Automatically releasing patch-level versions

Use the [shared autorelease workflow][] and the `GOVUK_CI_GITHUB_API_TOKEN`
secret to automatically raise a PR to perform a patch-level version bump if the
gem has unreleased changes, and all of those changes were authored by
Dependabot.

After a developer approves and merges that PR, the publish-rubygem workflow (if
present) will automatically publish the next release to Rubygems.

[shared autorelease workflow]: https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-infrastructure/blob/main/.github/workflows/autorelease-rubygem.yml

## Ruby version compatibility

Ensure gems are compatible with all [supported minor Ruby
versions][supported-rubies], specifying the minimum minor Ruby version in the gemspec
file. For example: `spec.required_ruby_version = ">= 3.1"`.

> Do not specify a patch (or "tiny") Ruby version unless there is a particular issue with a Ruby patch release.

The `.ruby-version` file should be the same minor version level as the
`required_ruby_version` in the gemspec, it is typically the most recent patch version.
For example: `spec.required_ruby_version >= "3.1"` would correlate to a `.ruby-version`
of 3.1.4.

When Ruby versions reach end-of-life (typically April) we update gems
to drop support for that Ruby version and update the `.ruby-version` files to
the next supported version. For example, when Ruby 2.7 reached end of life, we dropped 2.7
from the test matrices and we updated the `.ruby-version` file to be the most
recent release of the 3.0 branch, which in March 2023 was 3.0.5
(see [example][example-pr-dropping-ruby-support]).

We should then release the updated gem as a *minor version*.
In the past, [our policy was to release as a major version][old-policy-major-version],
but this was superfluous given that the change is low risk (Dependabot shouldnâ€™t
even raise a PR unless the upstream app is on a supported Ruby version). It also
limited our ability to benefit from the automated workflows agreed in RFC-156,
which [apply only to patch and minor version upgrades][rfc-156-versions].
Note that patch versions are generally reserved only for bug fixes.
