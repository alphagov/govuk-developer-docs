When you join the GOV.UK Data Labs team, you must set up your local machine and join Google groups.

## Set up your local machine

To set up your local machine, follow the [Get started on GOV.UK documentation](https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/manual/get-started.html).

Once you have set up your local machine by following this documentation, you should have access to GitHub and AWS. If you are a data scientist, ask in the [GOV.UK Data Labs slack channel](https://gds.slack.com/archives/CHR4UQKU4) for someone to add you to the:

- `ukgovdatascience` organisation in GitHub
- `govuk-integration-datascience` AWS role, also known as the `govuk-datascienceusers` AWS IAM role
