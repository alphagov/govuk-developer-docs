## Manual

Related links can be added or removed manually through [Content Tagger][].
To do this, you can click on the **Edit a page** link at the top and enter the
base path of the content item you need to edit. You will then see a section
titled **Related content items** where you can add, edit or remove related links.

If a request comes in a from a content designer to edit the related links of a
page, you can send them to Content Tagger so they can edit the links
themselves. You may also wish to point them to this guidance for managing related
links using Content Tagger.
