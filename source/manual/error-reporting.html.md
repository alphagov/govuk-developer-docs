We use [Sentry][] to notify us of exceptions that happen in all environments.

We configure Sentry using [govuk-saas-config][]. It reads a list of apps from the docs and makes sure that all configuration is set up correctly.

Use the [govuk_app_config][] gem to configure your application to talk to Sentry.
