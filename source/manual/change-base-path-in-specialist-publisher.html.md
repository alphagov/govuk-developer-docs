In [Specialist Publisher](https://specialist-publisher.publishing.service.gov.uk/), the base path is automatically generated based on the title when the specialist document is first created. We sometimes receive Zendesk tickets to change a base path when the title has been updated, as the publisher does not have the ability to do this.

You can use the Jenkins rake task runner to run the task:

```
base_path:edit[content_id,/new_base_path]
```

> **Note**
>
> You can find the `content_id` of the document using the [govuk-toolkit](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-browser-extension) browser extension.
