If you're seeing errors similar to `java.lang.IllegalStateException: Could not load plugin descriptor for existing plugin [cloud-aws]. Was the plugin built before 2.0?` in the elasticsearch log files then you should run the `[fix-elasticsearch-2.4.sh][fix-elasticsearch-script]` script

```shell
$ /var/govuk/govuk-puppet/development-vm/fix-elasticsearch-2.4.sh 
```
