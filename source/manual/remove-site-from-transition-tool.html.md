Sometimes we get requests to delete sites from the [Transition tool](https://transition.publishing.service.gov.uk).

## 1. Remove the site from Transition using the Delete functionality

If you have the Site Manager permission for Transition, you will see a "Delete" link on each site page. You'll have to confirm the deletion before any action is taken.

## 2. Check that the site is no longer recognised by the Transition tool

When all caches have cleared, the host will not appear in [hosts.json](https://transition.publishing.service.gov.uk/hosts).
