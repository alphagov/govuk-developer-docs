We sync all the data to two [S3] buckets:

- from asset-slave-1.backend using [Duplicity]
- from asset-slave-2.backend using [s3cmd]

See the [offsite backups alert page] for information on how to check the status
of the backups and rerun the backup job.

Data can also be [restored from backups] using Duplicity.

Note: Asset Manager now also stores the asset files as objects in an S3 bucket
(i.e. `govuk-assets-production` in production) and instructs Nginx to proxy
requests to them. Thus the Asset Manager portion of the NFS mount is now largely
redundant and the files on it will shortly be removed. Versioning is enabled on
the S3 bucket and it is replicated to another versioned S3 bucket
(i.e. `govuk-assets-backup-production` in production) in another AWS region.
