When something goes wrong on GOV.UK we follow our [incident management procedure][inc]. As part of that we update our status page:

ðŸ‘‰ [status.publishing.service.gov.uk][status]

The page is managed using a third party service called [Statuspage.io][sp].

ðŸ‘‰ Go to [manage.statuspage.io][man]

## What to write

Remember: government publishers are the main audience of the page. Write in non-technical language. Prefer to use the templates, they've been proofread.

### "Investigating" status

Provide reassurance that we are working on it.

Example:

> Weâ€™ve been told that publishers arenâ€™t able to upload attachments to pages. Weâ€™re looking into why this is happening.

### "Identified" status

We've found that the problem is.

Example:

> Weâ€™ve found the problem â€“ the server is overloaded and canâ€™t process new files. Weâ€™re working on fixing it, we think itâ€™ll take approximately 3 hours to fix.

### "Monitoring" status

We've fixed the issue - but keeping are an eye on it.

> We've solved the problem and implemented a fix. We're waiting for the unsent emails to go out.

### "Resolved" status

We've fixed the issue and everything is back to normal. Incident is closed.

> The problem has been resolved and the publishing platform is stable again. Apologies for the inconvenience.
