You may wish to load test email-alert-api to get a realistic idea of how the system performs under high load, or if your're making changes to how emails are processed to ensure your changes have the desired effect.

> Rake tasks for load testing can be found [here](https://github.com/alphagov/email-alert-api/blob/master/lib/tasks/load_testing.rake).

## Testing without Notify

email-alert-api has [a DelayProvider](https://github.com/alphagov/email-alert-api/blob/master/app/providers/delay_provider.rb) to simulate the delay of actual requests to Notify, so we can focus on internal load testing, without Notify being a factor. You will need to:

- Deploy [this PR or similar](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-puppet/pull/10412) to the Staging environment.

- Run Puppet on each of the machines.
  ```
  fab -P staging_aws class:email_alert_api puppet
  ```

- Disable Puppet to persist the temporary change.
  ```
  fab -P staging_aws class:email_alert_api 'puppet.disable:"<date> load testing"'
  ```

- Manualy restart the workers to pick up the change.
  ```
  fab -P staging_aws class:email_alert_api app.restart:email-alert-api-procfile-worker
  ```

## Testing with Notify

> Let the Notify team know if youâ€™re planning on doing a large scale test (anything more than a few thousand emails) and they can scale it up as necessary.

Normally emails from the Staging environment are [severely rate limited](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk/using-notify/trial-mode). You can repoint the NotifyProvider to a Staging version of Notify, which is more realistic. You will need to:

- Update [the Puppet Deploy job](https://deploy.blue.staging.govuk.digital/job/Deploy_Puppet/configure) to use [a branch of govuk-secrets with the required API key](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-secrets/pull/993). The API key is stored in [the **infra** pass store](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-secrets/blob/master/pass/infra/.gpg-id) in govuk-secrets under `govuk-notify/test-api-key`.

- Deploy [this PR or similar](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-puppet/pull/10413) to the Staging environment.

- Run Puppet on each of the machines.
  ```
  fab -P staging_aws class:email_alert_api puppet
  ```

- Disable Puppet to persist the temporary change.
  ```
  fab -P staging_aws class:email_alert_api 'puppet.disable:"<date> load testing"'
  ```

- Manualy restart the workers to pick up the change.
  ```
  fab -P staging_aws class:email_alert_api app.restart:email-alert-api-procfile-worker
  ```

## After the test

Once you've finished the test and the queues have been cleared, re-enable puppet runs, run puppet in order to overwrite the environment variables you've set, restart the workers again and let 2nd line and Notify know you've finished.
