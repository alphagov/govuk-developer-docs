# GitHub Enterprise

Our GitHub Enterprise installation lives at https://github.gds/ and is manged
by the GDS service desk.

On GOV.UK we use GitHub Enterprise to store repositories that we're not comfortable
maintaining as private repositories on public GitHub.

GOV.UK data on GitHub Enterprise should be encrypted in the repository (for example
using a list of GOV.UK GPG keys).
