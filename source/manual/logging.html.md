## Logit

GOV.UK is following [The GDS Way guidance on logging][gds-way-logging] by using
the approved vendor [Logit][logit].

For information on how to log in and view stacks, please see the
[GOV.UK Logit documentation][logit-docs].

### Elasticsearch

Elasticsearch in AWS uses a managed service.  Logs are exported to
[AWS Cloudwatch][aws-cloudwatch-es] and retained for 3 days.

Logs are also written to a [S3 bucket][s3-es] which is used to import the logs
into Logit.

## Filebeat

Each machine runs [Elastic Filebeat][filebeat], and independently ships logs to
the Logit-provided logstash endpoint.

Filebeat tails logs every 10 seconds and can output to a variety of sources. It
is fully incorporated into the Elastic ecosystem.

We use [the `filebeat::prospector` defined type][filebeat_prospector] to create
the filebeat configuration on each instance.

## Logstream and Logship

We have a defined type in our Puppet code which uses [logship][logship] to tail
logfiles. We only use Logstream to send nginx metrics, via statsd, to Graphite.

In the future this will be replaced.

## Kibana

Kibana is the interface for viewing logs in Elasticsearch. Use the Logit
interface to login to Kibana.

There's some documentation on [useful Kibana queries for 2nd line][kibana-docs].

[kibana-docs]: /manual/kibana.html

## Fastly

Fastly sends logs to S3 for the www, assets and bouncer
services. These can be [queried through Athena](/manual/query-cdn-logs.html).

## Graphite

Data from statsd goes to Graphite instances which is then displayed using
Grafana.

## Analytics through Athena

> This documentation is adapted from the [Email Alert API analytics documentation][email-athena]
> which also uses Athena

[Athena][athena] is Amazon's service for querying files in S3 using an SQL-like
syntax. The logs bucket is set up to be crawled by AWS Glue every day in order to
discover new partitions and configure the schema correctly.

Athena is accessible through the AWS control panel by following the
[instructions][console-instructions] for accessing the AWS console.
To access the production data you will need to use the
`govuk-infrastructure-production` account, once there you can head to
[athena](https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/athena) and select the
`fastly_logs` database.

There are [16 fields to query][athena-fields], plus the year, month and date
as partitions. **It is vastly cheaper and faster to query with
[partitions](#always-query-with-partitions)**.

Querying Athena is done through a SQL dialect provided by
[presto](https://prestodb.io/) - query [documentation][athena-queries] is
available.

### Always query with partitions

You should always query with a where condition which defines the partitions
to be used in your result set e.g. `WHERE year=2018 AND month=7 AND date=4`
unless you are sure you need a wider data range.

The data is stored in directories which separate the data by year, month and
date values. By applying a partition to the query, such as `WHERE year=2018 AND
month=7 AND date=4` you reduce the data needed to be traversed in the query
to just the files from that single day. Which naturally makes the query
perform substantially quicker.

Each query against Athena has a
[monetary cost](https://aws.amazon.com/athena/pricing/) - at time of writing $5
per TB of data scanned - and by using partitions you massively reduce the data
that needs to be scanned.

### Example queries

#### Number of requests per TLS version

```sql
SELECT "tls_client_protocol", count(*)
FROM "fastly_logs"."govuk_www"
WHERE "year" = 2018 AND "month" = 8 AND "date" = 5
GROUP BY "tls_client_protocol";
```

#### Number of errors returned during an incident

```sql
SELECT "status", count(*)
FROM "fastly_logs"."govuk_www"
WHERE "year" = 2018 AND "month" = 8 AND "date" = 5
AND "request_received"
  BETWEEN timestamp '2018-08-05 10:00:00'
  AND timestamp '2018-08-05 11:00:00'
GROUP BY "status";
```

### Adding a new field to the CDN logs

Adding a new field to the CDN logs is a half manual, half automated
process and is [tracked as tech debt](https://trello.com/c/7pAvfM8R/167).

You should do this in the Integration environment first and wait until
you see the logs coming through to Athena from Fastly. Only then
should you change Staging and next Production. This helps us catch
syntax errors and incidents early. Note that the `bouncer` logs are
only available in Production.

Firstly, make the manual changes via Terraform and a PR. This ensures that you've
had two pairs of eyes on both the Athena/AWS Glue config changes and the eventual JSON
you will manually put into the Fastly web UI:

1. Edit the [`infra-fastly-logs` Terraform](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-aws/blob/master/terraform/projects/infra-fastly-logs/main.tf).
1. Find the `aws_glue_catalog_table` resource for the Fastly logs you want to add a column to (`govuk_www`, `govuk_assets` or `bouncer`).
1. Copy the VCL for the log from [Fastly's list of available logs][fastly-logs-list] and add it to the list of commented (`//`) columns. It's important that these are in the same format as the preceeding commented lines (that is, JSON, with quotes) otherwise Athena won't parse the logs correctly. Here's an [example for the `govuk_www.cache_response` column](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-aws/blob/master/terraform/projects/infra-fastly-logs/main.tf#L251).
1. Add your new column name, type and description to the JSON below the comments ([example for the `govuk_www.cache_response` column](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-aws/blob/master/terraform/projects/infra-fastly-logs/main.tf#L330-L334).
1. Raise a PR, get a review, merge and [deploy](manual/deploying-terraform.html).

The manual steps to make Fastly send the log data:

1. Log in to Fastly using the credentials from `fastly/deployment_shared_credentials` in the 2ndline password store.
1. Search for the environment, for example "staging".
1. On the environment page, click "Real Time Stats".
1. Click "Configure" on the page with the graphs.
1. Click the blue "Edit Configuration" button on the far right to reveal a dropdown menu.
1. Click "Clone version xxx (active) to edit".
1. Click "Logging" in the left hand menu.
1. Find and click the link for the relevant log, for example "GOV.UK Fastly Logs S3 Bucket".
1. Paste the new log format (found [in the list of available Fastly logs][fastly-logs-list]) into the "Log Format" text box.
1. Click "Update".
1. Click the purple "ACTIVATE" button in the top right corner to make the new configuration live.

Both these sets of steps must be done! Check the S3 bucket and
query Athena to see the added column and confirm that there's data for
it. As the crawler runs on a schedule every four hours, it can take a
while for Athena to recognise that there have been changes to the
configuration. Due to this, it's advisable to manually [run the AWS
Glue Crawler](https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/glue/home?region=eu-west-1#catalog:tab=crawlers)
for the logs config you have changed once you know that Fastly is
correct.

Once you're happy that the Integration configuration works, you can
deploy Terraform to Staging and make the same manual changes in the
Fastly UI. Then do Production.
