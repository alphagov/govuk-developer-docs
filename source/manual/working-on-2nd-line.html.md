When working on 2nd line, we look at Normal and High priority tickets in the Zendesk ['2nd Line--GOV.UK Alerts and Issues' queue](https://govuk.zendesk.com/agent/filters/30791708).

## Triaging Zendesk tickets
See the [diagram for how 2nd line triage Zendesk tickets](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1mUnkONOrto2SKRKAO6JnnSUHRLsMy4eZEoq75BGxC6E/edit#slide=id.g39d428fe59_0_0) - there is a printout on the 2nd line desk.

Other things to know:

* If a departmental content request is urgent, content designers will triage their ticket to the ‘2nd line GOV.UK Alerts and Issues’ queue.
* If you cannot solve a ticket immediately, reply to the requester and let them know you’re looking into it.
* If a ticket has been resolved and pending a response  for 5 or more days with no response from the requester, submit it as solved with  a message telling them why and that if they still need help they can get in touch.

## Improving 2nd line

If you notice an area that can be improved, add your idea and an explanation to the [GOV.UK 2nd line Trello board](https://trello.com/b/M7UzqXpk/govuk-2nd-line). For example, if you have a temporary fix but think we should look into a long term solution for the problem.
