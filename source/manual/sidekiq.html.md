Many of our applications use
[Sidekiq](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq) for background job processing.

There's a [GOV.UK wrapper](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_sidekiq) that will
help you set it up.

## Monitoring

There are two approaches for monitoring Sidekiq, via the Sidekiq Web interface,
or the Grafana dashboard.

### Sidekiq Web

[Sidekiq] comes with a web application,
[`Sidekiq::Web`](https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/wiki/Monitoring)
that can display the current state of a [Sidekiq] installation. We have
[configured this](https://github.com/alphagov/sidekiq-monitoring) to monitor
multiple [Sidekiq] configurations used throughout [GOV.UK].

We have restricted public access as the Web UI allows modifying the state of
[Sidekiq] queues.

To gain access you should setup SSH port forwarding to a backend box belonging
to the environment you wish to monitor when connected to the office wireless
network or the VPN:

```bash
$ ssh backend-1.backend.staging -CNL 9000:127.0.0.1:3211
```

Or on AWS:

```bash
$ ssh $(ssh integration "govuk_node_list --single-node -c backend").integration -CNL 9000:127.0.0.1:3211
```

or using `govuk-connect`:

```bash
$ brew install alphagov/gds/govuk-connect
$ gds govuk connect sidekiq-monitoring -e production aws/backend 
```

Then visit [http://127.0.0.1:9000](http://127.0.0.1:9000) to see a list of
[Sidekiq] configurations you can monitor.

### Sidekiq Grafana Dashboard

You can also monitor Sidekiq queue lengths using [this Grafana
dashboard](https://grafana.publishing.service.gov.uk/dashboard/file/sidekiq.json). It
is available in all environments.

## Retry logic

Sidekiq has in built retry logic (turned on by default, but configurable).
Middleware is used to send metrics (successes, failures, job timings and retry
counts) to `statsd`, which forwards the data to Graphite to be stored.

Jobs do fail, this is not inherently bad and can happen for a number of
reasons. When a job fails it gets retried with an exponential backoff (up to 21
days), as long as retries are enabled. A high number of retries signifies a
bigger, less transient problem maybe occurring.
