Sometimes it may be necessary to republish content to the Publishing API. This will refresh the content on the website.

For example if we make an update to [govspeak][govspeak-repo] and a publishing application pre-renders that content prior to its submission to Publishing API, that would require us to re-render and save new HTML for content.

This process varies per app and requires [Production access][production-access].

You may wish to test first on integration, prior to carrying out the republish in production.

## Whitehall

If the documents are in Whitehall, you can republish content (individually or in bulk) via the user interface:

- [Whitehall integration](https://whitehall-admin.integration.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/admin/republishing)
- [Whitehall staging](https://whitehall-admin.staging.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/admin/republishing)
- [Whitehall production](https://whitehall-admin.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/admin/republishing)

Try to pick the task most focused to the scope of what you need to republish to avoid unnecessary load. You can monitor the effect on the publishing queue via these Grafana dashboards:

- [Grafana integration](https://grafana.integration.publishing.service.gov.uk/dashboard/file/sidekiq.json?refresh=1m&orgId=1&var-Application=whitehall&var-Interval=$__auto_interval)
- [Grafana staging](https://grafana.blue.staging.govuk.digital/dashboard/file/sidekiq.json?refresh=1m&orgId=1&var-Application=whitehall&var-Interval=$__auto_interval)
- [Grafana production](https://grafana.blue.production.govuk.digital/dashboard/file/sidekiq.json?refresh=1m&orgId=1&var-Application=whitehall&var-Interval=$__auto_interval)

## Content Publisher

If the document is in content publisher, there is a [resync Rake task][resync-rake-task] you can run.

You can resync a single document by passing it a content ID and locale:

<%= RunRakeTask.links("content-publisher", "resync:document[a-content-id:locale]") %>

or you can resync all documents:

<%= RunRakeTask.links("content-publisher", "resync:all") %>
