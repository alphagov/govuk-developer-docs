One or more tokens for API Users are about to expire. You should rotate
expiring tokens to ensure the associated application keeps working.

## Rotate a Signon API token

> ðŸª¨ This procedure is [toil](https://sre.google/workbook/eliminating-toil/) and should be eliminated or automated away. For now, it's unfortunately still a manual process.

Note that the overnight token sync cronjob will over-write any changes made in the Staging environment to match those in the Production environment so this procedure need only be followed for the Production and Integration environments. Any alerts relating to the Staging environment can be safely ignored.

The Integration environment should also be updated overnight but this is not happening currently. It is a known issue that when fixed will mean this procedure will need only to be followed for the Production environment.

### Special cases

If the token is for `Trade Tariff Admin` or `Trade Tariff Backend`, see [Trade Tariff Admin on the Wiki](https://gov-uk.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/PLOPS/pages/3155099649/Trade+Tariff+Admin)

If the token is for `Signon API Client (permission and suspension updater)` then the key will rotate automatically and the alert can be ignored.

### 1. Issue a new token

1. Go to the [APIs page](https://signon.publishing.service.gov.uk/api_users) in Signon.

1. From the **API users** table, choose the API User whose **Email** matches the `api_user` field in the alert.

1. Choose **Manage tokens**.

1. Choose **Add application token**.

1. From the **Application** dropdown, select the application that matches the `application` field in the alert.

1. Choose **Create access token**.

1. Take one of the following actions:
    * For a token used in an application outside of GOV.UK (e.g. by HMRC): securely send the token to the consumer.
    * For a token used by another GOV.UK application: follow the steps in the section below.

### 2. Update the token in the secrets used by the consuming application

> This only applies for tokens used by internal GOV.UK applications.

1. Update the token in the Kubernetes secret:

    1. Go to the Argo interface for the environment: [integration](https://argo.eks.integration.govuk.digital/applications/cluster-services/signon?view=tree&orphaned=false&resource=), [staging](https://argo.eks.staging.govuk.digital/applications/cluster-services/signon?view=tree&orphaned=false&resource=) or [production](https://argo.eks.production.govuk.digital/applications/cluster-services/signon?view=tree&orphaned=false&resource=).

    1. Locate the `signon-sync-token-secrets-to-k8s` cron job.

    1. Click the three dots on this cron job and click **Create job**.

    1. Wait for the job to complete. A sucessful run will be labelled with a green checkmark and a label such as `Healthy 1 pods`. The logs can also be choosing the **Logs** option for the most recent run.

1. Check that the client application works with the new token:

    1. Open a Rails console on the client app. For example, if the `api_user` is `short-url-manager@alphagov.co.uk`, open a console on `short-url-manager`.

        ```sh
        k exec -it deploy/short-url-manager -- rails c
        ```

    1. Fetch the environment variable that contains the token. The variable name refers to the server (destination) application, which is the same as the `application` field in the alert. For example, for short-url-manager (client) talking to publishing-api (server):

        ```ruby
        ENV["PUBLISHING_API_BEARER_TOKEN"]
        ```

        Check that the result matches the new token in Signon and not the old one.

    1. You can also check that the token works by making an API call yourself from the client app's Rails console. For example, to check that Short URL Manager can talk to Publishing API, you could:

        1. Choose a method from the publishing-api client library in [gds-api-adaptors](https://github.com/alphagov/gds-api-adapters/tree/main/lib/gds_api).
        1. Call the method from short-url-manager's Rails console:

            ```ruby
            client = GdsApi::PublishingApi.new(
              Plek.new.find("publishing-api"),
              bearer_token: ENV["PUBLISHING_API_BEARER_TOKEN"]
            )
            client.lookup_content_id(base_path: "/")
            ```

            The call should return some result and not raise an exception.

1. Once you have confirmed that the application is working with the new token, go back to Signon and revoke the old token. On the **Manage tokens** page, choose the **Revoke** link for the old token.
