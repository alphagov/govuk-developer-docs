We have a few monitoring checks for Redis:

- memory usage
- number of connected clients

Redis is configured to use 75% of the system memory. If Redis memory usage
reaches this limit it will stop accepting data input. Redis is also unable to
write its RDB data dumps when it's out of memory, so data loss is possible.

Since version 2.6, Redis [dynamically sets the maximum allowed number of
clients][redis-clients] to 32 less than the number of file
descriptors that can be opened at a time.

## General Redis investigation tips

If Redis is using large amounts of memory you can use ``redis-cli --bigkeys``
to find out what those things might be. If any of the returned keys are new, try and speak to the team responsible.

If there is an associated graph, it may also be worth checking as the alert could be a temporary spike, for example: due to running a rake task.

### Uniquejobs hash

We use a [custom fork][unique-jobs] of a gem called `sidekiq-unique-jobs` in some of our applications. This gem creates a key in Redis called `uniquejobs`

We have had an incident where the `uniquejobs` key has grown to the point that it caused high memory alerts for Redis. You can delete this key safely by runnning the following command on the associated Redis box:

```bash
$ redis-cli DEL uniquejobs
```

We have noticed that when this key grows on the redis box used by the Publishing
Api (currently `redis-1`), it can be accompanied by high Sidekiq queue latency
for Whitehall's queues. You can check the queue latency on the [Grafana
dashboard][whitehall-sidekiq-grafana].

### Redis in AWS

In AWS we are using a hosted Redis cluster `blue-backend-redis` , provided by AWS ElastiCache.
Monitoring information on the nodes can be obtained via the [AWS Console](https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/elasticache/home?region=eu-west-1#redis-group-nodes:id=blue-backend-redis;clusters=blue-backend-redis-001!blue-backend-redis-002).

In order to access the Redis command line interface in AWS, it is required to log in to the
`db-admin` machine via the [primary endpoint url of the cluster](https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/elasticache/home?region=eu-west-1#redis-group-detail:id=blue-backend-redis).

```bash
redis-cli -h <primary_endpoint url>
```

**Note:** Our Redis cluster contains multiple databases (currently 2, one for
GOV.UK's publishing platform and another for data.gov.uk). Select the database
with the `redis-cli` flag `-n <db_number>`. Bear this mind for all commands,
such as when using `--bigkeys`.

### Debugging tools for high memory usage

General routes you can take when Redis nodes are running out of memory:

1. Look at the CloudWatch metrics for the Redis Cluster
1. Submit a support ticket to AWS - we pay them for this
1. Increase the size of the Redis nodes (if appropriate)
1. Look at dashboards (Sidekiq, DGU) to see whether jobs are being processed
1. Use `--bigkeys` and other available tools from `redis-cli` (note that in older
  Redis versions, many useful commands such as `MEMORY` are not available).
1. Take a snapshot of a replica node, copy the RDB backup file locally and
  use a tool such as [redis-rdb-tools][] to generate a memory report, which
  can tell you which keys are using the most memory e.g.

  ```
  rdb -c memory /snapshot.rdb --largest 20 -f memory.csv
  ```
