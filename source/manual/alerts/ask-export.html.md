The Ask Export job takes the responses to the [Ask survey][] and puts them into different google drives depending on the intended recipient. This alert means that the nightly export has failed. Please [re-run the job][]. If this doesn't work check the Jenkins output.

The export relies on integrations with Smart Survey, Google and AWS. It could be that an access key has been deleted, a full list of the keys required for this job can be found [in Puppet][].
