### High queue size (queue_size)

This means that there are a high number of items in the queue. This may
indicate a problem down the line which is preventing workers from being
processed. It may also imply the threshold is too low if a large number of
emails have being sent out due to a content change.

See the [sidekiq][sidekiq] section for more information about the Sidekiq queues,
or read [email troubleshooting].
