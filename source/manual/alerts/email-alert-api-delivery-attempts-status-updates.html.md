Delivery attempts include status updates from Notify on whether emails have been
sent successfully. You can read more about them in [Notify's documentation][notify-documentation].

The alert is triggered when a proportion of delivery attempts are still `pending`
and we have not received the status updates from Notify within the past hour.
This could mean there is a problem with our system, or there could be a problem
with Notify.

###Â Check which delivery attempts are affected

```ruby
  DeliveryAttempt.where("created_at > ?", (1.hour + 10.minutes).ago).where(status: 0)
```

### Monitor the dashboard

You can also check the [Email Alert API Metrics dashboard][dashboard] to see if
we are still receiving updates from Notify.

See the [General troubleshooting tips][troubleshooting] section for more information.
