This alert relates to disk usage of our databases (RDS) in AWS being higher than we would expect. There are two ways to check the current usage.

- [Access the AWS web console][] and view the statistics.
- [Access the `db-admin` instance][] via SSH and access the database console. Then you should be able to view the current queries in action.

[Access the AWS web console]: https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/rds/home?region=eu-west-1
[Access the `db-admin` instance]: https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/manual/howto-ssh-to-machines.html
