The inode usage on a box can be checked using:

    df -i

which will give an output like:

    Filesystem           Inodes  IUsed   IFree IUse% Mounted on
    /dev/mapper/os-root 3121152 151646 2969506    5% /

with a row for each filesystem currently mounted.

### Low available disk inodes (any machine)

Gem documentation consumes a lot of inodes.
[We no longer install it](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-puppet/pull/7036),
but there may still be some on the machine. You can remove it with:

    find /usr/lib/rbenv/ -name *.ri | sudo xargs -n1 rm

### Low available disk inodes (Jenkins)

If Jenkins is running out of inodes (rather than disk space) then it may
be possible to free some by clearing out old workspaces:

    find /var/lib/jenkins/workspace/ -maxdepth 1 -type d -mtime +1 -exec rm -rf {} \;

Which will find any directories that are older than 1 day and delete
them.

### Low available disk space on Jenkins

One possible cause of this is that the /var/lib/docker directory is
consuming a large amount of disk space. This has been found to happen on
the ci-agent machines.

Verify this:

    cd /var/lib
    sudo ncdu

If `/var/lib/docker` is consuming a large amount of disk space run the
following as root:

    docker rmi $(docker images --filter "dangling=true" -q --no-trunc)
    docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -qf dangling=true)

This will remove 'dangling' images and volumes. A comprehensive set of
instructions can be found is this [Docker resource cleanup
gist](https://gist.github.com/bastman/5b57ddb3c11942094f8d0a97d461b430).
