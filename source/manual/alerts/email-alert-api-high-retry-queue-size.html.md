### High retry queue size (retry_size)

This means there are a high number of items in the retry queue. The Email Alert
API relies on the retry queue for rate limiting, so itâ€™s not unusual to see
items in the queue, but if it is very high it suggests that there may be a
problem down the line which is preventing jobs from being processed. It may
also imply the threshold is too low if a large number of emails have been sent
out due to a content change.

See the [sidekiq][sidekiq] section for more information about the Sidekiq queues,
or read [email troubleshooting].
