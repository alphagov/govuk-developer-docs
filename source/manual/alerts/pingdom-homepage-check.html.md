[Pingdom][] monitors externally (from ~10 locations in Europe and America)
that it can connect to <https://www.gov.uk>. If this fails it could
indicate that DNS for www.gov.uk is not working, our CDN has failed or
GOV.UK and all the static mirrors are inaccessible, which would
qualify as a major incident.

If you can confirm that GOV.UK is globally inaccessible,
this is cause to first alert other people who may be able to
help, then start troubleshooting to see if you can narrow down the
failure.

- [Pingdom Twitter account](https://twitter.com/pingdom) - check if
  they have announced issues
- [Fastly Service status](http://status.fastly.com/) - check if the
  CDN has global issues
- [AWS status](https://status.aws.amazon.com/) - check if our
  main provider has issues
