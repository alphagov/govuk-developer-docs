Under high load, it is possible that the Varnish child process which
handles connections will timeout on the healthcheck from the parent. If
that happens and the replacement child process also fails to start,
Varnish can get in a state where it is not responsive.

The 'varnish port not responding' check attempts to contact
<http://localhost:7999/> and get a response. If it doesn't, then it will
raise an urgent alert as this might lead to 1/3 of user requests
failing.

To diagnose, check for messages like this:

```
$ fab $environment -H cache-3.router sdo:'grep varnishd /var/log/messages'
[cache-3.router] out: Jul  7 00:17:02 cache-3 varnishd[1620]: Child (1630) died signal=3
[cache-3.router] out: Jul  7 00:17:03 cache-3 varnishd[1620]: child (27973) Started
[cache-3.router] out: Jul  7 00:17:25 cache-3 varnishd[1620]: Child (27973) said Child starts
[cache-3.router] out: Jul  7 00:17:25 cache-3 varnishd[1620]: Child (27973) said Child dies
[cache-3.router] out: Jul  7 00:17:25 cache-3 varnishd[1620]: Child (27973) died status=1
```

You may see only one process called `/usr/sbin/varnishd` in the
process table, with owner root. The child process if it exists will be
owned by nobody:

```
$ fab $environment -H cache-3.router do:'ps -ef | grep [/]usr/sbin/varnishd'
[cache-3.router] out: root      8273     1  0 06:08 ?        00:00:00 /usr/sbin/varnishd -P /var/run/varnishd.pid -a :7999 -f /etc/varnish/default.vcl -T 127.0.0.1:6082 -t 900 -w 1,1000,120 -S /etc/varnish/secret -s malloc,5985M
[cache-3.router] out: nobody    8277  8273  1 06:08 ?        00:03:52 /usr/sbin/varnishd -P /var/run/varnishd.pid -a :7999 -f /etc/varnish/default.vcl -T 127.0.0.1:6082 -t 900 -w 1,1000,120 -S /etc/varnish/secret -s malloc,5985M
```

Check whether there are any children of the current parent process (this check
will fail where it succeeds below):

```
$ fab $environment -H cache-3.router do:'/usr/lib/nagios/plugins/check_procs -c 1:1 -C 'varnishd' -p `< /var/run/varnishd.pid`''
[cache-3.router] out: PROCS OK: 1 process with command name 'varnishd', PPID = 8273
```

### To resolve Varnish port not responding

Restart Varnish on this machine:

```
$ fab $environment -H cache-3.router cache.restart
```
