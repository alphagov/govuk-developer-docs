### High queue latency (queue_latency)

This means the time it takes for a job to be processed is unusually high. This
may indicate a problem down the line which is preventing workers from being
processed. It may also imply the threshold is too low if a large number of
emails have being sent out due to a content change.

See the [sidekiq][sidekiq] section for more information about the Sidekiq queues.
