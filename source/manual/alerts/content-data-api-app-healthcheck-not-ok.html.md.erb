## What is the ETL process

ETL stands for [Extract, Transform, Load][etl_definition].
Every day, data is copied from multiple sources (the [publishing platform],
[user feedback], and Google Analytics) into the Content Data API warehouse.

A rake task called [`etl:master`][etl_master] calls the `Etl::Master::MasterProcessor`
which [processes all the data][etl_master_class]. This rake task is run daily
(see ["When does ETL run"](#when-does-etl-run) section below) so that the
[Content Data] app has up to date figures.

The Jenkins job that calls this rake task is [content_data_api][content_data_api_job]
([configured here][content_data_api_job_config]).

There is also a special 're-run' task called [`etl:rerun_master`][etl_rerun],
which takes an inclusive range of dates as arguments, and runs the same task
as above but overriding the previously held data. We can run this if we have
reason to believe the historical data is no longer accurate.

The Jenkins job for this rake task is [content_data_api_re_run][content_data_api_re_run_job]
([configured here][content_data_api_re_run_job_config]).

## When does ETL run

The [content_data_api job][content_data_api_job] runs at:

* [7am in production][cron_production]
* [11am in staging][cron_staging]
* [1pm in integration][cron_integration] 

These jobs are spread out for rate limiting reasons, and production is run
outside of normal hours so as not to impact database performance during the day.

The [content_data_api_re_run job][content_data_api_re_run_job]
[runs at 3AM][cron_rerun] in every environment. This job was added
because of a [delay in results showing up in Google Analytics][google_delay],
meaning results can take between 24-48 hours to appear in GA. The production
ETL running at 7am allowed only 7 hours for the data to appear in GA. The
re-run job collects the data after 2 days, leaving time for the data to appear
correctly in GA.

## Troubleshooting

Below are the possible problems you may see. Note that the rake tasks should
be run on the `content-data-api` TARGET_APPLICATION and the `backend` MACHINE_CLASS.

> **All dates for the rake tasks below are inclusive.**
> In other words, if you only need to reprocess data for a specific day, you’ll need
> to use the same the date for both the 'from' and 'to' parameters
> (for example: `etl:repopulate_aggregations_month["2019-12-15","2019-12-15"]`).

### ETL :: no monthly aggregations of metrics for yesterday

This means that [the ETL master process][1] that runs daily that creates
aggregations of the metrics failed.

To fix this problem run the [following rake task][5]:

<%= RunRakeTask.links("content-data-api", "etl:repopulate_aggregations_month[YYYY-MM-DD,YYYY-MM-DD]") %>

### ETL :: no <range> searches updated from yesterday

This means that [the Etl process][1] that runs daily and refreshes the
Materialized Views failed to update those views.

To fix this problem run the [following rake task][6]:

<%= RunRakeTask.links("content-data-api", "etl:repopulate_aggregations_search") %>

### ETL :: no daily metrics for yesterday

This means that [the ETL master process][1] that runs daily to retrieve
metrics for content items has failed.

To fix this problem [re-run the master process again][1]

**Note** This will first delete any metrics that had been successfully
retrieved before re-running the task to regather all metrics.

### ETL :: no pviews for yesterday

This means the [the ETL master process][1] that runs daily has failed to
collect `pageview` metrics from Google Analytics. The issue may originate
from the [ETL processor responsible for collecting core metrics][9].

To fix this problem run the [following rake task][2]:

<%= RunRakeTask.links("content-data-api", "etl:repopulateviews[YYYY-MM-DD,YYYY-MM-DD]") %>

### ETL :: no upviews for yesterday

This means the [the ETL master process][1] that runs daily has failed to
collect `unique pageview` metrics from Google Analytics. The issue may
originate from the [ETL processor responsible for collecting core metrics][9].

To fix this problem run the [following rake task][2]:

<%= RunRakeTask.links("content-data-api", "etl:repopulateviews[YYYY-MM-DD,YYYY-MM-DD]") %>

### ETL :: no searches for yesterday

This means the [the ETL master process][1] that runs daily has failed to
collect `number of searches` metrics from Google Analytics. The issue may
originate from the [ETL processor responsible for collecting Internal Searches][10].

To fix this problem run the [following rake task][3]:

<%= RunRakeTask.links("content-data-api", "etl:repopulate_searches[YYYY-MM-DD,YYYY-MM-DD]") %>

### ETL :: no feedex for yesterday

This means the [the ETL master process][1] that runs daily has failed to
collect `feedex` metrics from `support-api`. The issue may originate from the
[ETL processor responsible for collecting Feedex comments][11].

To fix this problem run the [following rake task][4]:

<%= RunRakeTask.links("content-data-api", "etl:repopulate_feedex[YYYY-MM-DD,YYYY-MM-DD]") %>
