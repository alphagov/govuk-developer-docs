The reindex task is run weekly on a Monday at 9pm on integration. It
[reindexes][reindexing] every Elasticsearch index used by [search-api][]. This is
to ensure the process works as expected when we need to run it in production.
This task is manually run in production by the development team after they have
made and changes to the Elasticsearch schema.

If this process fails then please escalate to the [team currently responsible for search][search-api]
for further investigation.

This task can be run in Jenkins:
