# VPN down

We use VPNs to connect between datacentres. Please see
GOV.UK and Virtual
Private Networks (VPNs) &lt;/infrastructure/vpn&gt; for details of the
VPNs we have and a description of the impact of each VPN failing.

If a VPN is down, it is likely caused by a network issue due to a vendor
incident or our own misconfiguration. If no changes have been made
recently to our [network
configuration](https://github.gds/gds/govuk-provisioning), the best
action is to contact the vendors involved. If the VPN connects one
vendor to another, you should open a ticket with each vendor as the
problem could lie on either side.
