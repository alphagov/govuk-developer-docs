If there is a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) alert in Icinga this means that AWS have detected a probable DDoS attack on one or more of the AWS Shield Advanced
protected resources.

If the alert is `UNKNOWN`, this means that the alert is not working properly.

If the alert is `CRITICAL`, you should take the following actions to investigate the issue:

1. Check the [CloudWatch dashboard](https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/home?region=eu-west-1#cw:dashboard=DDoSProtection). This should show the rate of DDoS requests, data throughput and packets which Amazon is detecting.
    * The dashboard might not display any graphs at all if no DDoS activity has been detected recently. This is a known issue and there is a [support ticket](https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/cases#/6554017771/en) open with Amazon about it. If the DDoSDetected alert is firing and the graphs are still not displayed, contact AWS support.
1. If the attack is ongoing, contact AWS support: https://console.aws.amazon.com/support/home
1. Inform them that the DDOSDetected alarm has been triggered.
1. Enquire about the nature of the attack.
1. Follow their instructions (if any).

The alert will appear on the Icinga dashboard for 24 hours after it was first triggered
due to the sparse metrics.
