We use [Terraform](https://terraform.io) for configuring the GOV.UK
infrastructure in AWS.

## 1. Check what you can deploy

Which changes you can deploy depends on the level of access you have
to our AWS environments.

- `govuk-users` can't deploy anything
- `govuk-powerusers` and `govuk-platformhealth-powerusers` can deploy everything except IAM (users and policies).
- `govuk-administrators` can deploy everything including IAM.

You can find which class of user you are [in the infra-security
project in
govuk-aws-data](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-aws-data/tree/master/data/infra-security).

Choose either steps 2 and 3, or step 4 to continue.

## 2. Get your credentials

Before deploying you'll have to assume a role for the environment you're deploying to.

```sh
aws sts assume-role \
  --role-session-name "$(whoami)-$(date +%d-%m-%y_%H-%M)" \
  --role-arn <Role ARN> \
  --serial-number <MFA ARN> \
  --duration-seconds 28800 \
  --profile gds \
  --token-code <MFA token>
```

If you've [set up AWS CLI correctly](/manual/aws-cli-access.html) you can get the Role ARN and MFA ARN with `cat ~/.aws/config`.

## 3. Terraform `plan` & `deploy`

ðŸ‘‰ [Deploy to integration using Jenkins][deploy-integration]

## 4. Use `tools/deploy.rb`

The Ruby script `tools/deploy.rb` in the `govuk-aws` repository takes care of requesting temporary AWS credentials with an assumed role and queuing the deployment Jenkins job.

To use this script, you need to have [set up AWS CLI correctly](/manual/aws-cli-access.html) and have a [GitHub personal access token](https://github.com/settings/tokens).

Then, run the script like the following example:

```
GITHUB_USERNAME=<your GitHub username> GITHUB_TOKEN=<your GitHub personal access token> ruby deploy.rb plan integration blue app-backend
```

If your AWS session has expired, you'll be asked for your MFA code. Once the script has run, you can visit the [Jenkins job][deploy-integration] to see it running or queued.
