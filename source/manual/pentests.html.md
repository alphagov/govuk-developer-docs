GOV.UK periodically runs penetration tests (otherwise known as 'pentests' or 'IT healthchecks') on its infrastructure, to identify security issues. Any relevant documentation lives in the respective app repo or, if sensitive, in the the ITHC Google doc linked from the [govuk-ithc-documentation][] repo.
