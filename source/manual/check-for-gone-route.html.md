When a Whitehall document fails to appear on the frontend, and the user
is shown a 'Gone' page, follow these instructions:

## Check the router API for a `gone` route

    $ ssh router-backend-1.router.production
    $ govuk_app_console router-api
    > r = Route.where(incoming_path: '/path-to-item').first
    > puts r.handler

if the result is `gone` and you want to unblock the URL then you need to
remove the route (this works because `/government` is a `prefix` route
to Whitehall):

    > r.destroy
    > RouterReloader.reload
