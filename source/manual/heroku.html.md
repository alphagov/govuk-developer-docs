# Access apps on the shared Heroku account

We use Heroku to host some non-critical applications like the [monitoring-screen][].

The credentials for Heroku are found in
[gds/deployment](https://github.gds/gds/deployment/blob/master/pass/2ndline/heroku.gpg).

[monitoring-screen]: https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/manual/screens.html
