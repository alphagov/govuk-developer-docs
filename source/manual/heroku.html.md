We use Heroku to host some non-critical applications like the [monitoring screens][] and also for auto-deploying [review apps][].

The credentials for Heroku are in [govuk-secrets](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-secrets/blob/master/pass/2ndline/heroku/heroku.gpg).

[review apps]: review-apps.html
