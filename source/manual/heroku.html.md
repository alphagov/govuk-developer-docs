We use Heroku to host some non-critical applications like the [monitoring screens][] and also for auto-deploying [review apps][].

The credentials for Heroku are in [govuk-secrets](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-secrets/blob/master/pass/2ndline/heroku/heroku.gpg).

If you need to reset the password for the Heroku account, the email will be sent to a Google Group called [govuk-role-platform-accounts-members](https://groups.google.com/a/digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/g/govuk-role-platform-accounts-members). Only a few members of senior tech have access to this group at the moment.
