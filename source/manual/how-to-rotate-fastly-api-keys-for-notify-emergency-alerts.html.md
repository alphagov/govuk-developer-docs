The GOV.UK Notify team will occasionally request GOV.UK's help rotating some Fastly API keys which they use to purge Emergency Alerts
pages from the Fastly cache.

The process should be roughly:

* Make sure you can clone [Notify's secrets repository](https://github.com/alphagov/notifications-credentials/) (it's private, so you may need to be added)
* Sign in to Fastly using [the 2ndline password in govuk-secrets](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-secrets/blob/master/pass/2ndline/fastly/deployment_shared_account.gpg) (private repository)
* Visit [Account / Personal API tokens](https://manage.fastly.com/account/personal/tokens) in Fastly
* Search for "GOV.UK Notify /alerts" to find the current keys
* Click Create Token
* Re-enter the 2ndline password
* Name the token using the pattern `GOV.UK Notify /alerts $ENVIRONMENT $YEAR`
* Choose the specific service `$ENVIRONMENT GOV.UK`
* Select only purge select as the Scope
* Select "Never expire" for the expiration

* Click Create Token
* From the notifications-credentials repository, run `PASSWORD_STORE_DIR=$(pwd) pass insert credentials/fastly/${ENVIRONMENT}/api_key` to encrypt the api_key for the Notify team
* Once you've updated the API keys for all the environments, raise a PR [like this original PR](https://github.com/alphagov/notifications-credentials/pull/213) with the Notify team
* Once the Notify team have confirmed that they have deployed the new API keys no longer need the old keys, use the Fastly user interface to delete the old keys
