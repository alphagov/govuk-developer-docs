## Using govuk-docker

This assumes that you have already installed and setup [govuk-docker]. We will use [government-frontend] as an example here, but these instructions apply to any frontend app.

If you are making changes to a frontend app and nothing else, you can view these changes by running the following:

```shell
cd /govuk/govuk-docker
make government-frontend

cd /govuk/government-frontend
govuk-docker-up app-live
# You can now view the app on government-frontend.dev.gov.uk
```

If you want to test changes in [govuk_publishing_components] against a frontend app, you need to edit your frontend app Gemfile first:

```ruby
gem 'govuk_publishing_components', path: '../govuk_publishing_components'
```

```shell
cd /govuk/government-frontend
govuk-docker-run bundle install
govuk-docker-up app-live
# You can now view the app on government-frontend.dev.gov.uk
```

If you want to test changes in static against a frontend app, you need to tell Docker to look at your local version of static rather than live:

```shell
cd /govuk/govuk-docker/projects/government-frontend
```

Open `government-frontend`'s `docker-compose.yml` file, then edit the live config to depend on static and remove the live static environment:

```yaml
  government-frontend-app-live:
    <<: *government-frontend-app
  depends_on:
    ...
    - static-app # This tells docker that the app relies on static running locally
  environment:
    ...
    # Comment out this line to stop pointing to live static
    #PLEK_SERVICE_STATIC_URI: assets.publishing.service.gov.uk
```

We can now run the frontend application as normal:

```shell
cd /govuk/govuk-docker
make government-frontend

cd /govuk/government-frontend
govuk-docker-up app-live
# You can now view the app on government-frontend.dev.gov.uk
```

## Using startup scripts

**NOTE:** this approach only works for frontend development and relies on live APIs. You will need to find and install any dependencies yourself. Consider using the general GOV.UK Docker environment in the first instance.

If you are making changes to certain frontend apps you can also view these changes by running the application's `./startup.sh` script - if it has one. This example is for [government-frontend], but these instructions may apply to other frontend apps.

```shell
cd /govuk/government-frontend
./startup.sh --live
# Check the output to see what port the app is running on, e.g: localhost:3005
```

If you want to test changes in [govuk_publishing_components] against a frontend app, you need to edit your frontend app Gemfile and then run the startup script:

```ruby
gem 'govuk_publishing_components', path: '../govuk_publishing_components'
```

```shell
bundle install
./startup.sh --live
# Check the output to see what port the app is running on, e.g: localhost:3005
```

## Components pulled in by Static

Some components, such as the cookie banner, are pulled in by Static. To test changes to this component locally, we need to run a frontend app against both local static and local [govuk_publishing_components]. This can be done by combining the approaches above - just remember to update the Gemfile in Static too!

## Troubleshooting

### 504 Timeout Errors

Assets can load slowly, which means we get frequent timeouts when running apps locally. Some developers find that the following workaround can help:

1. Set `config.assets.debug` to `false` in the `development.rb` file in your frontend app
1. Run `bundle exec rake assets:precompile` manually
1. Start your app as normal

### Port already in use

You might sometimes find that you have something running on a port still, which stops you from starting up an app. To kill a process running on a port:

```shell
# replace [port number]
sudo fuser -k [port number]/tcp
```
