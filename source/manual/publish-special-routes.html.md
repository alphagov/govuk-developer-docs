The [Special Route Publisher](https://github.com/alphagov/special-route-publisher) is the home for all special routes that are currently published by a variety of apps to the Publishing API.

All new special routes should be created in this tool, and existing special routes should be moved as necessary.

The [Publish special routes Jenkins job](https://deploy.staging.publishing.service.gov.uk/job/Publish_Special_Routes/) will re-publish all defined special routes to the Publishing API.
