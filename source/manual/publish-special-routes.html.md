[Publishing API](https://github.com/alphagov/publishing-api) has a set of rake tasks for loading routes (a map of URL path to a rendering app and content ID) from a YAML file into Publishing API.

See [Publishing special routes](https://github.com/alphagov/publishing-api/blob/main/docs/admin-tasks.md#publishing-special-routes) for usage.
