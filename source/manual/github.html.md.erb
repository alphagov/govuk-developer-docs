We share the [alphagov GitHub organisation][alphagov] with the other teams in the
Government Digital Service (GDS). Our GitHub organisation is on the
Enterprise Cloud plan.

This can sometimes make it hard to find repositories that belong to our team. We use
GitHub "topics" to organise the repos. All repos owned by us should be tagged with
[`govuk`](https://github.com/search?q=topic:govuk).

If you are unable to access an alphagov repository you can contact the
[GDS Github Owners Google group](https://groups.google.com/a/digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/g/gds-github-owners), where members of that group have superadmin access to give you permissions to
contribute to a repo.

We use [govuk-saas-config][] to configure our repositories.

Also see the [GOV.UK reliance on GitHub features doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KsYWCHSQZEwqB2NF1A7Z9rmP1s1azcZhEamaPsXAoxk/edit#heading=h.75pp7jqw5sk9) for more information.
