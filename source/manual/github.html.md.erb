We share the [alphagov GitHub organisation][alphagov] with the other teams in the
Government Digital Service (GDS).

This can sometimes make it hard to find repositories that belong to our team. We use
GitHub "topics" to organise the repos. All repos owned by us should be tagged with
[`govuk`](https://github.com/search?q=topic:govuk).

We use [govuk-saas-config][] to configure our repositories.

## Topics on GitHub

<% AppDocs.topics_on_github.each do |topic| %>
- <%= link_to topic, "https://github.com/search?q=topic:#{topic}+org:alphagov" %>
<% end %>
