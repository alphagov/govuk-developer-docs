## Removing an asset

If you need to remove an asset manually from `assets.publishing.service.gov.uk`,
follow these steps:

1. Decide if the asset can be marked as deleted or whether all traces need to be
   removed (e.g. if it contains secret information). If all traces need to be
   removed, append `,true` in the square brackets when running the rake tasks
   below.

     To mark the file as deleted, run the following Rake task:

     The square brackets are part of the command, so don't remove them:
     <%= RunRakeTask.links("asset-manager", "assets:delete[ASSET_ID]") %>

1. Add a query string to the URL (e.g. `?cache-bust=12345`) to bypass the cache
   and check that the asset responds with a 404 not found.

1. Wait 20 minutes for the cache to clear, or [purge it yourself](/manual/purge-cache.html#purge-a-page-from-the-fastly-cdn).

1. Verify that the asset is not there without using query string.

1. Request removal of the asset using the [Google Search Console](https://www.google.com/webmasters/tools/removals).

1. Remove the asset from the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) mirror:
   - Log into the [GCP console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   - Go to the `GOVUK Production` project under the `DIGITAL.CABINET-OFFICE.GOV.UK`
     organisation.
   - Select `Cloud Storage -> Browser`, go to the [`govuk-production-mirror`
     bucket][govuk-production-mirror-gcp].
   - Navigate to the file, then delete it.

1. Remove the asset from the Amazon Web Services (AWS) mirror:

   `gds aws govuk-production-poweruser aws s3 rm s3://govuk-production-mirror/assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/<slug>`

[govuk-production-mirror-gcp]: https://console.cloud.google.com/storage/browser/govuk-production-mirror;tab=objects?forceOnBucketsSortingFiltering=false&project=govuk-production

## Redirecting an asset

Sometimes it might be necessary to manually redirect an asset, for example if
an associated document wasn't unpublished correctly. There are some Rake tasks
available for this:

<%= RunRakeTask.links("asset-manager", "assets:redirect[ASSET_ID,REDIRECT_URL]") %>

## Uploading an asset

Some publishing apps such as [Mainstream Publisher](/repos/publisher.html) do
not provide the facility for editors to upload assets such as images and PDFs.
In these rare cases, we can upload assets to asset-manager manually and give
the URL to content editors to embed.

Production assets are replicated to staging and integration nightly, so it is
best to simply perform the upload directly in production. First, upload the
asset to a backend machine:

```sh
$ gds govuk connect scp-push -e production aws/backend:1 my_file.jpg /tmp
```

Then SSH to the same machine and run the upload command:

```sh
$ gds govuk connect ssh -e production aws/backend:1
$ cd /var/apps/asset-manager
$ sudo -u deploy govuk_setenv asset-manager bin/create_asset /tmp/my_file.jpg
```

Note the `basepath` the script outputs. This should be appended to the asset
host, for example:

```
https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/57358658ed915d58bd000000/my_file.jpg
```

## Replacing an asset

If you need to replace the file of an existing attachment without
changing the URL, follow these steps:

0. Copy the new file from your computer to a `backend` server:

    ```sh
    $ gds govuk connect scp-push -e <environment> aws/backend:1 filename.ext /tmp
    ```

0. Get an app console on that same server:

    ```sh
    $ gds govuk connect ssh -e <environment> aws/backend:1
    $ govuk_app_console asset-manager
    ```

0. Find the asset:

    ```ruby
    asset = Asset.find("asset-id-from-url") # e.g. `57a9c52b40f0b608a700000a`
    ```

0. Check the asset is what you think it is.

0. Replace the file (change 123 to the new attachment size in bytes):

    ```ruby
    asset.update(size: 123)
    asset.file = Pathname.new("/tmp/filename.ext").open
    asset.save!
    ```

0. For a Whitehall pdf-attachments, update the file size and page count in Whitehall, where 123 is the new attachment size in bytes:

   ```sh
   $ kubectl exec -n apps -it deploy/whitehall-admin -- rails c
   ```

   ```ruby
   asset = Asset.where(asset_manager_id: asset-id-from-url).first # e.g. 123456
   attachment_data = asset.assetable
   attachment_data.update(file_size: 123, number_of_pages: 28)
   ```
