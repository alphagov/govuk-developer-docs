Backups of [RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/) instances are [taken
nightly](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-aws/tree/master/terraform/modules/aws/rds_instance).
They are stored in Amazon S3. SQL dumps are also taken nightly from the various
`db_admin` machines via the [`govuk_env_sync`](/manual/govuk-env-sync.html)
process.

## Restore an RDS instance via the AWS CLI

This documentation will illustrate how to restore a database (DB) instance from a DB Snapshot with AWS CLI.

Before you get started you need to know:

* The environment in which you are restoring the database - replace <environment> throughout the scripts
* The name of the database which needs to be restored - if you are restoring multiple databases, you will need to carry out these steps again for it

For more information, read the [AWS documentation on Restoring from a DB Snapshot](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_RestoreFromSnapshot.html).

### Step 1

Retrieve a list of all snapshot ARNs for your application (e.g. local-links-manager):

```
gds-cli aws govuk-<environment>-admin aws rds describe-db-snapshots --query 'DBSnapshots[].DBSnapshotArn' | grep local-links-manager
```

Then select the ARN with the latest date.

```
snapshot_arn=<arn_of_snapshot_database>
```

For example, `snapshot_arn=arn:aws:rds:eu-west-1:210287912431:snapshot:rds:local-links-manager-postgres-2022-07-05-01-09`.

Ensure that the right database ARN has been stored by:

```
echo ${snapshot_arn}
```

### Step 2

Find which database the snapshot was generated by getting the DBInstanceIdentifier by:

Example:

* db_instance_identifier=local-links-manager-postgres

```
gds-cli aws govuk-<environment>-admin aws rds describe-db-snapshots --db-snapshot-identifier ${snapshot_arn} --snapshot-type automated --query 'DBSnapshots[].DBInstanceIdentifier'
```

Store the DBInstanceIdentifier as a variable

```
db_instance_identifier=<DB_Instance_Identifier>
```

### Step 3

The restored database must have the same security groups and be in the same VPC (that's the "subnet group name" parameter) as the original one, otherwise, apps won't be able to connect to it. Therefore the database needs to be restored in the same VPC and with the same security groups as the original instance, the snapshot came from.

After running the command below, you now have all the parameters you need (snapshot-arn, db-instance-identifier, security-group-id, db-parameter-group-name, and db-subnet-group-name) to restore the database and change the restored database's security groups to match the original's.

```
gds-cli aws govuk-<environment>-admin aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-identifier ${db_instance_identifier} --query 'DBInstances[].[VpcSecurityGroups[].VpcSecurityGroupId,DBParameterGroups[].DBParameterGroupName,DBSubnetGroup.DBSubnetGroupName]'
```

Example of the output

* vpc-security-group-id = sg-XXXXXXXX
* db-parameter-group-name = local-links-manager-postgres-XXXXXXXXXX
* db-subnet-group-name = blue-govuk-rds-subnet

Store the output as a variable

```
vpc_security_group_id=<replace_with_previous_output>
db_parameter_group_name=<replace_with_previous_output>
db_subnet_group_name=<replace_with_previous_output>
```

### Step 4

Restore the database Instance from a Snapshot by:

```
gds-cli aws govuk-<environment>-admin aws rds restore-db-instance-from-db-snapshot --db-subnet-group-name ${db_subnet_group_name} --db-instance-identifier restored-${db_instance_identifier} --db-snapshot-identifier ${snapshot_arn}
```

To see the newly created database Instance, Log into AWS Console> Route 53  > Hosted Zone > view the public and private

### Step 5

Before moving on to the next step we need to ensure that the database has been fully restored and ready to be used by:

```
gds-cli aws govuk-<environment>-admin aws rds wait db-instance-available --db-instance-identifier restored-${db_instance_identifier}
```

This command will wait until the database is ready, and then exit without any output.

### Step 6

Modify the restored database Instance

```
gds-cli aws govuk-<environment>-admin aws rds modify-db-instance --db-instance-identifier restored-${db_instance_identifier} --vpc-security-group-ids ${vpc_security_group_id} --db-parameter-group-name ${db_parameter_group_name}
```

### Step 7

Once restored, you will need to update the DNS so that the restored database can be accessed on the internal domain.

To get the endpoint of the restored instance:

Example of Output

* Address = restored-local-links-manager-postgres.XXXXXX.eu-west-1.rds.amazon.com
* Port = 54XX

```
gds-cli aws govuk-<environment>-admin aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-identifier restored-${db_instance_identifier} --query 'DBInstances[].Endpoint'
```

Store the output as a variable

```
endpoint_address=<replace_with_address_output_above>
```

### Step 8

Get the zone ID of the GOV.UK internal domain name:

(It'll be in the form "Id": "/hostedzone/ZXXXXX" - only the Z section is required.)

Example

* NextHostedZoneId = ZXXXXXXXXXX

```
gds-cli aws govuk-<environment>-admin aws route53 list-hosted-zones-by-name --dns-name ${endpoint_address} --max-items 1
```

Store the output as a variable

```
next_hosted_zone_id=<replace_with_NextHostedZoneId>
```

### Step 9

Amazon Route53 doesn't have a command line to update just one DNS record. It requires a file for batch changes (even if there's only one).

For this step you will need to create a file (locally) - e.g. /var/tmp/update_dns.json, with the following code below.

Please be aware that you can store the file anywhere on your local drive but remember to update the file path in the next step.

Example

* database-name = restored-<name_old_db>
* stack-name = blue
* govuk-internal-domain = <enviornment>.govuk-internal.digital
* restored-db-endpoint= echo ${endpoint_address} in your terminal then copy and past into file

```
{
    "Comment": "Manual DB restore",
    "Changes": [
        {
            "Action": "UPSERT",
            "ResourceRecordSet": {
                "Name": "<database-name>.<stack-name>.<govuk-internal-domain>",
                "Type": "CNAME",
                "TTL": 300,
                "ResourceRecords": [
                    {
                        "Value": "<restored-db-endpoint>"
                    }
                ]
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

Apply these changes with the following command, and then the restore is finished!

Please be aware that if you changed the file path in the previous step, remember to change the code below.

```
gds-cli aws govuk-<environment>-admin aws route53 change-resource-record-sets --hosted-zone-id ${next_hosted_zone_id} --change-batch file:///var/tmp/update_dns.json
```

### Step 10

To see the changes to AWS Route 53, Log into AWS Console > Route 53 > Hosted Zones > Check the Public and private link to <environment>.govuk-internal.digital and search for the restored DB.

## How to Delete a Database Instance

> PLEASE BE CAREFUL WHEN EXECUTING THIS COMMAND AS IT CAN NOT BE UNDONE

For reference, here is the [AWS documentation for deleting a database instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/delete-db-instance.html#delete-db-instance).

The command below will delete a database instance, this is only to be used if there is an error with the current deployment of the replacement database or once created you've restored a database from a snapshot, you may also need to delete the old database.

The command below will also create a DB snapshot before the DB instance is deleted. If you don't want this, omit the `--no-skip-final-snapshot` parameter.

```
gds-cli aws govuk-<environment>-admin aws rds delete-db-instance --db-instance-identifier <db_instance_identifier> --no-skip-final-snapshot
```
