Backups of [RDS](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/) instances are [taken
nightly](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-aws/tree/master/terraform/modules/aws/rds_instance).
They are stored in Amazon S3. SQL dumps are also taken nightly from the various
`db_admin` machines via the [`govuk_env_sync`](/manual/govuk-env-sync.html)
process.

## Restore an RDS instance via the AWS CLI

This documentation will illustrate how to restore a database (DB) instance from a DB Snapshot with AWS CLI.

Before you get started you need to know:

* The environment in which you are restoring the database - replace <environment> throughout the scripts
* The name of the database which needs to be restored - if you are restoring multiple databases, you will need to carry out these steps again for it

For more information, read the [AWS documentation on Restoring from a DB Snapshot](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_RestoreFromSnapshot.html).

### 1. Retrieve a list of all snapshot ARNs for your application

In this example we are using `local-links-manager`:

```
gds-cli aws govuk-<environment>-admin aws rds describe-db-snapshots --query 'DBSnapshots[].DBSnapshotArn' | grep local-links-manager
```

Then select the ARN with the latest date.

```
snapshot_arn=<arn_of_snapshot_database>
```

For example, `snapshot_arn=arn:aws:rds:eu-west-1:210287912431:snapshot:rds:local-links-manager-postgres-2022-07-05-01-09`.

Ensure that the right database ARN has been stored by:

```
echo ${snapshot_arn}
```

### 2. Find which database the snapshot was generated by

You can get this using the `DBInstanceIdentifier`, for example:

* db_instance_identifier=local-links-manager-postgres

```
gds-cli aws govuk-<environment>-admin aws rds describe-db-snapshots --db-snapshot-identifier ${snapshot_arn} --snapshot-type automated --query 'DBSnapshots[].DBInstanceIdentifier'
```

Store the `DBInstanceIdentifier` as a variable:

```
db_instance_identifier=<DB_Instance_Identifier>
```

### 3. Ensure the restored database has the same security groups

The restored database must have the same security groups and be in the same VPC (that's the "subnet group name" parameter) as the original one, otherwise, apps won't be able to connect to it. Therefore the database needs to be restored in the same VPC and with the same security groups as the original instance the snapshot came from.

After running the command below, you now have all the parameters you need (snapshot-arn, db-instance-identifier, security-group-id, db-parameter-group-name, and db-subnet-group-name) to restore the database and change the restored database's security groups to match the original's.

```
gds-cli aws govuk-<environment>-admin aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-identifier ${db_instance_identifier} --query 'DBInstances[].[VpcSecurityGroups[].VpcSecurityGroupId,DBParameterGroups[].DBParameterGroupName,DBSubnetGroup.DBSubnetGroupName]'
```

Example of the output:

* vpc-security-group-id = sg-XXXXXXXX
* db-parameter-group-name = local-links-manager-postgres-XXXXXXXXXX
* db-subnet-group-name = blue-govuk-rds-subnet

Store the output as a variable:

```
vpc_security_group_id=<replace_with_previous_output>
db_parameter_group_name=<replace_with_previous_output>
db_subnet_group_name=<replace_with_previous_output>
```

### 4. Restore the database instance from a snapshot

Using the stored variables from the previous steps:

```
gds-cli aws govuk-<environment>-admin aws rds restore-db-instance-from-db-snapshot --db-subnet-group-name ${db_subnet_group_name} --db-instance-identifier restored-${db_instance_identifier} --db-snapshot-identifier ${snapshot_arn}
```

To see the newly created database instance, log into AWS Console > RDS > Databases > filter for your database name. You should see the original and newly created one.

### 5. Test the database has been fully restored

Before moving on to the next step we need to ensure that the database has been fully restored and ready to be used by:

```
gds-cli aws govuk-<environment>-admin aws rds wait db-instance-available --db-instance-identifier restored-${db_instance_identifier}
```

This command will wait until the database is ready, and then exit without any output.

### 6. Make a change to the database contents

Through the app's user interface, or via the app console or database console, make
a change that you can use as a sense check to verify that the database switch has
been successful.

For example, you might create a draft edition of something, or modify or delete
a record. After switching to the restored database, your changes should be undone.

In this example we want to make a change to the database `local-links-manager_production`
such as delete an old record:

```
sudo psql -U aws_db_admin -h local-links-manager-postgres -d local-links-manager_production
```

### 7. Connect to the restored backup database

This requires updating the CNAME for `local-links-manager-postgres`.

1. In AWS Route53 navigate to `Route 53 > Hosted zones > integration.govuk-internal.digital`
2. In the list search for the hostname and select it to edit the record.
3. Make a note of the current value if you are planning on reconnecting to the original database afterwards e.g. if you're carrying this out as a drill
4. Replace the value with the new RDS backup and save your changes. This takes about 60 seconds, you can click "view status" for updates. Once updated it will say `INSYNC`.
5. SSH back into the machine and query for the record you deleted. If the record is back this should verify the app is now using the backup database.

> This is only a temporary solution, to be used in an incident. You should continue onto the next section for a permanent solution.

## Delete an obsolete database

> PLEASE BE CAREFUL WHEN EXECUTING THIS COMMAND AS IT CANNOT BE UNDONE

For reference, here is the [AWS documentation for deleting a database instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/delete-db-instance.html#delete-db-instance).

It is likely that the restored database is missing data since the snapshot was taken and you
will want to have a copy of the original database for comparison before deleting it.

The command below will create a DB snapshot before the DB instance is deleted. If you don't want this, omit the `--final-db-snapshot-identifier` parameter.

```
gds-cli aws govuk-<environment>-admin aws rds delete-db-instance --db-instance-identifier <db_instance_identifier> --final-db-snapshot-identifier <snapshot_name>
```

You can check the snapshot is available by navigating to RDS > Snapshots in the AWS console.
Now that the original RDS instance has been removed this will free up the name for the
[permanent fix](#ensure-your-setup-will-continue-to-work-if-infrastructure-is-reprovisioned)).
