title: Backup and restore databases in AWS RDS

This playbook describes how to restore a database instance using Amazon's [RDS Backups](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_WorkingWithAutomatedBackups.html) feature.

We use RDS Backups to give us fully nightly backups and point-in-time recovery (PITR) (also known as continuous data protection or CDP).

> This playbook does not cover restoring from [govuk_env_sync backups](govuk-env-sync.html).

<!-- Force markdown to separate these quotes -->

> We only run RDS Backup in the production environment. To run a test restore in staging or integration, you must first take a manual snapshot from the AWS console.
>
> Make sure the snapshot's name contains the name of the app (e.g. `local-links-manager`), and remember to delete it afterwards.

## Restore an RDS instance via the AWS CLI

This documentation will illustrate how to restore a database (DB) instance from a DB Snapshot with AWS CLI.

Before you get started you need to know:

* The environment in which you are restoring the database - replace <environment> throughout the scripts
* The name of the database which needs to be restored - if you are restoring multiple databases, you will need to carry out these steps again for it

For more information, read the [AWS documentation on Restoring from a DB Snapshot](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_RestoreFromSnapshot.html).

### 1. Retrieve a list of all snapshot ARNs for your application

In this example we are using `local-links-manager`:

```
gds-cli aws govuk-<environment>-admin aws rds describe-db-snapshots --query 'DBSnapshots[].DBSnapshotArn' | grep local-links-manager
```

Then select the ARN with the latest date.

```
snapshot_arn=<arn_of_snapshot_database>
```

For example, `snapshot_arn=arn:aws:rds:eu-west-1:210287912431:snapshot:rds:local-links-manager-postgres-2022-07-05-01-09`.

Ensure that the right database ARN has been stored by:

```
echo ${snapshot_arn}
```

### 2. Find which database the snapshot was generated by

You can get this using the `DBInstanceIdentifier`, for example:

* db_instance_identifier=local-links-manager-postgres

```sh
gds-cli aws govuk-<environment>-admin aws rds describe-db-snapshots --db-snapshot-identifier ${snapshot_arn} --query 'DBSnapshots[].DBInstanceIdentifier'
```

Store the `DBInstanceIdentifier` as a variable:

```
db_instance_identifier=<DB_Instance_Identifier>
```

### 3. Ensure the restored database has the same security groups

The restored database must have the same security groups and be in the same VPC (that's the "subnet group name" parameter) as the original one, otherwise, apps won't be able to connect to it. Therefore the database needs to be restored in the same VPC and with the same security groups as the original instance the snapshot came from.

After running the command below, you now have all the parameters you need (snapshot-arn, db-instance-identifier, security-group-id, db-parameter-group-name, and db-subnet-group-name) to restore the database and change the restored database's security groups to match the original's.

```
gds-cli aws govuk-<environment>-admin aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-identifier ${db_instance_identifier} --query 'DBInstances[].[VpcSecurityGroups[].VpcSecurityGroupId,DBParameterGroups[].DBParameterGroupName,DBSubnetGroup.DBSubnetGroupName]'
```

Example of the output:

* vpc-security-group-id = sg-XXXXXXXX
* db-parameter-group-name = local-links-manager-postgres-XXXXXXXXXX
* db-subnet-group-name = blue-govuk-rds-subnet

Store the output as a variable:

```
vpc_security_group_id=<replace_with_previous_output>
db_parameter_group_name=<replace_with_previous_output>
db_subnet_group_name=<replace_with_previous_output>
```

### 4. Restore the database instance from a snapshot

Using the stored variables from the previous steps:

```
gds-cli aws govuk-<environment>-admin aws rds restore-db-instance-from-db-snapshot --db-subnet-group-name ${db_subnet_group_name} --db-instance-identifier restored-${db_instance_identifier} --db-snapshot-identifier ${snapshot_arn}
```

To see the newly created database instance, log into AWS Console > RDS > Databases > filter for your database name. You should see the original and newly created one.

### 5. Test the database has been fully restored

Before moving on to the next step we need to ensure that the database has been fully restored and ready to be used by:

```
gds-cli aws govuk-<environment>-admin aws rds wait db-instance-available --db-instance-identifier restored-${db_instance_identifier}
```

This command will wait until the database is ready, and then exit without any output.

### 6. Get the new database's hostname

Once the database is ready, fetch its hostname:

```
gds-cli aws govuk-<environment>-admin aws rds describe-db-instances --db-instance-identifier "restored-${db_instance_identifier}" --query 'DBInstances[].Endpoint.Address'
```

### 7. Make a change to the database contents

Through the app's user interface, or via the app console, make a change that you
can use as a sense check to verify that the database switch has been successful.

For example, you might create a draft edition of something, or modify or delete
a record. After switching to the restored database, your changes should be undone.

In this example we open a Rails console on local-links-manager, from which we can
make a change such as deleting an old record:

```
kubectl exec -n apps -it deploy/local-links-manager -- bundle exec rails c
```

### 8. Connect to the restored backup database

This requires updating the `govuk/local-links-manager/postgres` secret in AWS Secrets Manager.

1. Log in to AWS in the correct environment: `gds aws govuk-<environment>-admin -l`
1. In AWS Secrets Manager, search for and click on `govuk/local-links-manager/postgres`.
1. Under the "Overview" tab, in the "Secret Value" section, select "Retrieve Secret Value".
1. Make a note of the existing value, in case you need to revert the changes (for example, if performing a drill).
1. Click "Edit", and replace the value of the "host" and "dbInstanceIdentifier" fields with the URL and identifier of the new database instance. Click "Save".
   > Some of our apps currently refer to their database directly (e.g. `app-name.hex-string.eu-west-1.rds.amazonaws.com`), some of them refer to their database indirectly via a `CNAME` record (e.g. `app-name.blue.staging.govuk-internal.digital`). In either case, you can replace this with the URL of the new database instance.
1. Log into Argo CD in the correct environment ([integration](https://argo.eks.integration.govuk.digital/),
    [staging](https://argo.eks.staging.govuk.digital/), [production](https://argo.eks.production.govuk.digital/)).
1. Navigate to the `external-secrets` app, locate the `local-links-manager-postgres` external secret, select the "..." menu, and select "Refresh".
1. After refreshing this secret, the app's pods should automatically be restarted pointing at the correct database instance. To confirm that this happened, navigate to the `local-links-manager` app, locate the `local-links-manager` deployment, and check the uptime of the pods.
    > If the pods were not automatically restarted, select the "..." menu next to the deployment, and select "Restart".
1. Verify that the app is now using the backup database by checking if the change you made in the previous step has been reverted.

## Delete an obsolete database

> PLEASE BE CAREFUL WHEN EXECUTING THIS COMMAND AS IT CANNOT BE UNDONE

For reference, here is the [AWS documentation for deleting a database instance](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/rds/delete-db-instance.html#delete-db-instance).

It is likely that the restored database is missing data since the snapshot was taken and you
will want to have a copy of the original database for comparison before deleting it.

The command below will create a DB snapshot before the DB instance is deleted. If you don't want this, omit the `--final-db-snapshot-identifier` parameter.

```
gds-cli aws govuk-<environment>-admin aws rds delete-db-instance --db-instance-identifier <db_instance_identifier> --final-db-snapshot-identifier <snapshot_name>
```

You can check the snapshot is available by navigating to RDS > Snapshots in the AWS console.
