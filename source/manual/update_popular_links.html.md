Popular links on GOV.UK are shown on the home page under 'Popular on GOV.UK'.

## How to access and edit popular links

Popular links can be accessed and edited via the 'Homepage' link on Signon, for this we need the 'homepage_editor' permission inside the Mainstream Publisher app.

### Note

There is no separate app for homepage, all the code for homepage lives inside the Mainstream Publisher app and hence any user permission required for homepage is also managed via the Mainstream Publisher app.

To read more about the design and implementation decisions for homepage you can read [the documentation](https://github.com/alphagov/publisher/blob/main/docs/homepage.md).
