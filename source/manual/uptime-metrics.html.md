Uptime metrics are collected for the `content-store` and the `publishing-api`,
they are available as [a Grafana dashboard][grafana-dashboard].

They are available broken down into a day by day view, highlighted in different
colours representing the level of uptime. Green means 100%, orange means above
99.31% (equivalent to 10 minutes of downtime) and red for everything else.

## Further Reading

The service which collects the uptime data runs on the monitoring machines and
is available to see in [govuk-puppet][uptime-collector-pr]. It works by polling
`/healthcheck` every 5 seconds and records an application is up if it receives
a 2xx HTTP status code back. It uses statsd to send this data to Graphite under
the names `stats.guages.uptime.<application>` which is the used in the Grafana
dashboard.

If you would like to add another app to the uptime collector, you should first
make sure there is a `/healthcheck` endpoint available and then add your
application to [the end of the line in the service file][uptime-service-file].
