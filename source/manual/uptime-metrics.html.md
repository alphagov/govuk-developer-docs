Uptime metrics are collected for `content-store`, `hmrc-manuals-api`,
`link-checker-api`, `manuals-publisher`, `publishing-api`, `specialist-publisher`,
`travel-advice-publisher` and `whitehall-admin`, they are available as
[a Grafana dashboard][grafana-dashboard].

They are available broken down into a day by day view, highlighted in different
colours representing the level of uptime. Green means 100%, orange means above
99.31% (equivalent to 10 minutes of downtime) and red for everything else.

>**Note** These metrics aren't a true reflection of availability. Loadbalancing means that
>even if a particular healthcheck fails, and the metrics change as a result, publishing is
>unlikely to be affected.

## Further Reading

The service which collects the uptime data runs on the monitoring machines and
is available to see in [govuk-puppet][uptime-collector-pr]. It works by polling
a given endpoint, such as`/healthcheck`, every 5 seconds and records an application
is up if it receives a 2xx HTTP status code back. It uses statsd to send this data to Graphite under
the names `stats.guages.uptime.<application>` which is the used in the Grafana
dashboard.

If you would like to add another app to the uptime collector, you should first
make sure there is a `/healthcheck` endpoint available and then add your
application to [the end of the line in the service file][uptime-service-file].

>**Note** If there is not an exposed `/healthcheck` endpoint available, an alternative
>can be given by using the format `service_name:alternative/endpoint`.
