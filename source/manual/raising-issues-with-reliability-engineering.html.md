Reliability Engineering are a programme in GDS, they are responsible for the
infrastructure that most GDS software runs on and the underlying network
configuration. They also provide shared software services used by
various GDS programmes such as logging and monitoring tools.

When on 2nd line you may experience an issue with GOV.UK that requires asking the RE GOV.UK team in Reliability Engineering for assistance.

There are [Reliability Engineering docs](https://reliability-engineering.cloudapps.digital/) for users of their systems. There are also [other Reliability Engineering docs](https://re-team-manual.cloudapps.digital/) for use by the team, these may contain more technical details.

## If you require urgent assistance

The RE GOV.UK have a Slack channel - #re-govuk - and they
have an assigned interruptible person. By posting in that channel you can get
their attention. This channel can be used for general queries too so do
indicate in your message that a problem is time critical.

Failing slack communication you can also walk over to the RE GOV.UK team desks and talk to the interruptible person directly - they are currently on the 6th floor near bank 27-28.

It is also possible to "Run a Play" in the context of an ongoing incident page in PagerDuty. This will automatically call the RE engineer on duty both in- and out-of-hours.

## If you need to handover a long-standing incident

If this is in-hours:
A Site Reliabilty Engineer from the RE GOV.UK team should take over the incident lead role.
A 2nd line GOV.UK engineer will continue the comms lead role.

If this is out-of-hours:
The primary GOV.UK engineer should be the incident lead and support the RE GOV.UK out of hours engineer to fix the problem. The secondary GOV.UK engineer should be the comms lead.

To escalate an incident to the RE GOV.UK engineer via PagerDuty:

1. Click on the incident in PagerDuty
2. Click on ‘Run a play’ to select ‘call the RE GOV.UK on-call person’

## If a problem is not urgent

You can use the #reliability-eng slack channel for advice. If the issue you've
identified seems like a non-urgent story you can add it the
[GOV.UK 2nd Line][2nd-line-trello] trello board in the "Proposed stories for
Platform Health" column. Platform Health will then decide whether to raise this
with RE, and manage the ticket through its life cycle, or to resolve this
problem themselves.

## Understanding what Reliability Engineering can assist with

There is a broad explanation of the different areas of support in GOV.UK in
[who do I ask for support?](/manual/who-do-i-ask-for-support.html).

More specificially to GOV.UK these are things that fall under the
responsibility of Reliability Engineering (RE):

- [GOV.UK Puppet](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-puppet) - RE are
  responsible for maintenance and evolution, but as GOV.UK merge changes they
  can too be responsible for problems
- Upgrading software packages that are end-of-life/have security issues/no
  longer fit for purpose
- Running and maintaining the
  [Terraform configurations](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-aws/) for AWS;
- Backup software such as Duplicity
- Maintaining the mirror configuration
- Keeping the CI environment running - GOV.UK are responsible for job
  configuration
- [Fabric scripts](https://github.com/alphagov/fabric-scripts)
