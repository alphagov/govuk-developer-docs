You may experience an issue with GOV.UK where you need help from a Site Reliability Engineer (SRE). The SREs generally work on the _Platform Engineering_ team.

## If you require assistance

Ask in `#govuk-ask-platform-engineering`.

## Understanding what SREs can assist with

There is a broad explanation of the different areas of support in GOV.UK in
[ask for help](/manual/ask-for-help.html).

SREs can help with:

- Scalability and resilience
- Designing or improving monitoring, metrics, tracing and observability of system behaviour
- Troubleshooting complex problems
- Designing new systems or backend (APIs, information storage and processing) features
- Designing for graceful degradation under failure conditions (for example the GOV.UK static mirrors)
- Migrating from legacy systems, for example [GOV.UK Puppet](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-puppet)
- Upgrading software packages that are end-of-life/have security issues/no longer fit for purpose
- Advice on how to structure or maintain [Terraform modules](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-aws/) for managing cloud resources
- Continuous deployment and continuous delivery systems (CI/CD), build and release automation
