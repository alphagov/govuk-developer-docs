You can deploy Puppet using the following steps:

> **NOTE**
>
> Puppet is automatically deployed to integration by a combination of the [integration-puppet-deploy job on Jenkins CI](https://ci-deploy.integration.publishing.service.gov.uk/job/Deploy_Puppet/) and [Deploy Puppet job on Jenkins Deploy](https://deploy.integration.publishing.service.gov.uk/job/Deploy_Puppet/).

> **WARNING**
>
> If you're deploying a change to [hiera.yml](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-puppet/blob/master/hiera.yml) or [hiera_aws.yml](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-puppet/blob/master/hiera_aws.yml), you will need to restart the Puppet server on the Puppet Master machine, otherwise these changes will not be picked up.
>
> To restart the server, run `sudo service puppetserver restart`.

1. Get the [release tag of the build that you wish to deploy][tag] from the Release
   app (`release_18295` for example). Look at the diff you're going to deploy.

2. Deploy the newer version to staging by using the 'Deploy to Staging (Carrenza)'
   and 'Deploy to Staging (AWS)' buttons in the Release app after clicking on the release
   tag.

3. You will either need to wait 30 minutes or read about [convergence](#convergence).
   You should monitor Icinga and Smokey, and test anything you're concerned about.

4. Deploy the newer version to production by using the 'Deploy to Production' buttons in
   the Release app after clicking on the release tag.

5. You will either need to wait 30 minutes or read about [convergence](#convergence).
   You should monitor Icinga and Smokey, and test anything you're concerned about.

## Convergence

The deployment only pushes the new code to the Puppet Master. Each node
runs a Puppet agent every 30 minutes (via cron), so it may be some time
before the release takes effect. This has an implication on how
quickly you can go from staging to production.

If you'd rather not wait and you're able to safely determine from the
diff what classes of machines the change will affect, you can use
[Fabric](https://github.com/alphagov/fabric-scripts) to force a run of
Puppet. For example:

    fab $environment class:frontend_lb class:backend_lb puppet

This will run in serial across the nodes so there is a reduced chance of
downtime caused by a service restarting on all nodes of a given
class at the same time. You should still be careful though, because
some services take longer to restart than others.

## Preventing service restarts

It may occassionally be neccessary to trick Puppet into not restarting a
service, if it is a single point of failure and doing so would cause a
brief outage, e.g. MySQL.

> **WARNING**
>
> This is not a "normal" procedure. You should only do this if you need
> to and you MUST have some plan for restarting the service in the near
> future so that it's not inconsistent with its configuration.

1.  Disable normal Puppet runs on the affected nodes:

        fab $environment class:mysql_master puppet.disable:'Preventing service restart'

2.  Change the file content to match what Puppet wants it to be. If it's
    a plain file you can probably apply the diff from git using
    `sudo patch source.diff dest`. If it's a template then you may need
    to refer to an existing environment or figure it out yourself.
3.  Verify that Puppet won't change the file or notify the service by
    running it in `noop` mode. You will need to provide a different lock
    path to bypass the disable:

        govuk_puppet --noop --test --agent_disabled_lockfile=/tmp/puppet.noop

4.  If you're happy with the results then re-enable Puppet and run it
    again:

        fab $environment class:mysql_master puppet.enable puppet

5.  Schedule a time to actually restart the service if necessary.
