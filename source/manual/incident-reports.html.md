### Root cause analysis

A root cause is an underlying factor why an incident occurred, which when fixed would prevent a recurrence. Identify and summarise all of the root causes that led to the incident in a short paragraph, aimed at a non-technical audience.

Reference all root cause categories that apply, for instance;

* Unexpected effect of code change
* Configuration fault (configuration change, pre-existing fault, etc)
* Capacity issue (insufficient capacity to meet demand, implementation issue, etc)
* Provider / third-party infrastructure failure (hardware, network failure, etc)
* Workflow issue (usability issue, misoperation, etc)
* Software design / architecture problem (i.e. worked as designed but led to a problem)
* Other (please specify)

...

* Why was this not caught before it reached production, if applicable?
* Were we alerted quickly?
* Were we able to diagnose and fix the immediate issue quickly?
* Has the underlying issue been fixed?, if not how do we prevent a recurrence?
* What other fixes/changes have been taken or need to take place as a result, if any?
* What things helped during the incident?
* What things hindered during the incident?
* Was the process followed well and were comms effective?
