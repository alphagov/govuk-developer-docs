The [Content Store][content-store-repo] is the store for all published content on
GOV.UK. When given a path, it responds with the content that should be displayed
on that path.

While it is primarily intended for the use of the frontend apps, it is also
exposed externally at `https://www.gov.uk/api/content/<path>`, where `<path>` is
the full path of the item on GOV.UK.

For more detailed documentation on the API exposed by the Content Store, you can
[read through the GOV.UK Content API Documentation][content-api-docs].
