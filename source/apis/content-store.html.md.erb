The [Content Store][content-store-repo] is the store for all published content on
GOV.UK. When given a path, it responds with the content that should be displayed
on that path.

Limitations:

- Not all content is in the content-store yet. There are pages that
don't use the publishing platform and can't be found in the content store
(at the time of writing, [pages about past prime ministers](https://www.gov.uk/government/history/past-prime-ministers/gordon-brown)).
- For some pages the content store will not return all the content on the page (an [organisation page](https://www.gov.uk/api/content/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs) for example)

While it is primarily intended for the use of the frontend apps, it is also
exposed externally at `https://www.gov.uk/api/content/<path>`, where `<path>` is
the full path of the item on GOV.UK.

For more detailed documentation on the API exposed by the Content Store, you can
[read through the GOV.UK Content API Documentation][content-api-docs].
