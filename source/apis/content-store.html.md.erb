The [Content Store][content-store-repo] is the store for all published content on
GOV.UK. When given a path, it responds with the content that should be displayed
on that path.

While it is primarily intended for the use of the frontend apps, it is also
exposed externally at `https://www.gov.uk/api/content/<path>`, where `<path>` is
the full path of the item on GOV.UK.

The full list of fields in a document depends on the document type and schema
name, which are themselves fields included at the top level; these schemas are
defined in the [govuk-content-schemas repository][schemas-repo]. However, the
bulk of the fields are common between all schemas, and these are primarily
contained in three sections, as detailed below.

## Top level fields

These fields are constant across all document types.

`base_path`: The main path that this content item is served on. Some items will
contain data for multiple pages; these will all be sub-pages contained under the
base_path.

`content_id`: The unique identifier for this content item. This uuid remains
constant throughout the lifetime of a piece of content, and is used to identify
an item across our systems.

`schema_name`: The individual schema in [govuk-content-schemas][schemas-repo]
that this item conforms to; used in validation. Examples include "publication",
"detailed_guide".

`document_type`: The type of document; frequently the same as schema_name but
may differ when one schema contains many sub-types - for example, publications
includes "policy_paper", "notice", "national_statistics", etc.

`title`: The title of the document.

`description`: A summary of the content. This is often displayed on the search
or index page for this item.

`public_updated_at`: The timestamp of the last major update to this content.

`first_published_at`: The timestamp that this content was first published.

`last_edited_at`: The timestamp this content was last edited.

`updated_at`: Timestamp of the last change made to this item.

`publishing_app`: The app that created this content and is responsible for
editing it. Examples include "whitehall", "specialist-publisher".

`rendering_app`: The frontend app that is responsible for displaying this
content. Examples include "government-frontend", "manuals-frontend".

`locale`: The language of the content, eg "en", "ar".

`need_ids`: The IDs of the user needs that this content serves, as denoted by
the Need API. Deprecated.

`analytics_identifier`: The identifier to use in Google Analytics for this
content.

`withdrawn_notice`: The text to display at the top of this item indicating it
is no longer current, along with the timestamp it was withdrawn.

`details`: As hash containing the full details for this content, see below.

`links`: A hash containing all the links and tags for an item; see below.

## Details

These fields differ per document type, but may include the following:

`body`: The full body text of the item, in HTML (rendered from govspeak).

`change_history`: An array listing all the major changes to an item; each
element consists of a timestamp and a note describing the change.

`political`: boolean flag indicating whether this content relates to the
policies of a particular government.

`government`: a hash containing the title of the government responsible for
publishing this content, and a boolean indicating whether it is the current
government.

`documents`: an array of attachments associated with the current item. Each
document is presented as a rendered piece of HTML including link and thumbnail.

`image`: the URL of an image to display alongside the item.

## Links

Each element in this hash is an array of hashes containing links of a certain
type. The particular elements in the hash will depend on the schema type, but
common ones include:

`available_translations`: Pages that contain translations of this content into
other languages.

`organisations`: Government bodies that own or are responsible for this content.

`parent`: The item that is the parent of this document; eg an index page, or
the publication page in the case of HTML publications.

`children`: The items that are children of this page.

`mainstream_browse_pages`: The sections under the /browse area of the site
that this content will appear in.

The exact selection of fields inside each of these hashes is dependent on what
is needed to display in the frontend, so may differ per link type. However, all
links will include the following fields:

`content_id`: The unique identifer of the linked content item.

`base_path`: The linked item's path on the site.

`api_path`: The path for the linked item in this API.

`title`: The title of the linked item.

`description`: Summary of the content of the linked item.

`document_type`: The type of the linked document.

`schema_name`: The schema in [govuk-content-schemas][schemas-repo] that the
linked item conforms to.

`locale`: The locale of the linked item. Usually, if a translation of the
linked content into the same language as the current item exists, the link will
point to that translation; otherwise, it will default to the English version.

`links`: Any recursive links relevant to rendering this item.
