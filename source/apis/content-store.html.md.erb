##Â Limitations of the content API

- Not all content is in the content-store yet. There are pages that
don't use the publishing platform and can't be found in the content store
(at the time of writing, [pages about past prime ministers][past-prime-ministers]).
- For some pages the content store will not return all the content on the page (an
[organisation page][organisation-page] for example).
- Not all content in the store has a publicly queryable path, e.g. facets. They can
only be queried via their ID, using the search API:
  - https://www.gov.uk/api/search.json?filter_content_id=894a7c88-40bb-46-a234-b7e15d8a0c21
  - https://www.gov.uk/api/search.json?filter_facet_values=77764805-73e6-4d47-9f20-aedd6de7dab9
