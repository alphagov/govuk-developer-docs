# Taxonomy

GOV.UK's "single subject taxonomy" intends to describe all content on GOV.UK. It is being developed theme-by-theme, starting with education.

## 1. Editing taxonomy

The taxonomy is managed in [content-tagger][edit-taxonomy].

The topics in the taxonomy (we call them "taxons" in code) are persisted in the publishing-api as content items. For an example [see the "Education" taxon][education-taxon].

The link type `parent_taxons` is used to store the relationship between taxons. Link expansion makes sure that the taxons will have a `child_taxons` link type too.

## 2. Tagging

All pages can be tagged to the taxonomy, currently in [content-tagger][content-tagger] too.

In the future, editors will also be able to tag to the taxonomy in publishing apps like [Whitehall][whitehall].

The relationship between a page and a taxon is persisted in the publishing-api "links hash". For example, see the [taxons link in the content item for this guidance document][example-guidance].

## 3. Accessing the taxonomy

This is the content item for the top-level "Education" taxon:

[https://www.gov.uk/api/content/education][education-taxon]

You can use this to find the structure of the taxonomy by following the `child_taxons` links.

## 4. Accessing tagged content

All content tagged to a particular taxon you fetch from the search API ([rummager][rummager]).

This works with a `content_id` rather than URL. To find all content tagged to the above mentioned ["Education taxon"][education-taxon]:

[https://www.gov.uk/api/search.json?filter_taxons[]=c58fdadd-7743-46d6-9629-90bb3ccc4ef0](https://www.gov.uk/api/search.json?filter_taxons[]=c58fdadd-7743-46d6-9629-90bb3ccc4ef0)
