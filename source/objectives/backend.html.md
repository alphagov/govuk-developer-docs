# Baseline objectives for backend developers on GOV.UK

These objectives attempt to lay out what we mean by a "good backend developer" on GOV.UK, and what we hope that developers on GOV.UK are aspiring to. These are the standards and behaviours need to attain a performance score of "Achieving".

These objectives are a starting point for line managers and should be modified to reflect the work of the team. The format for the objectives is taken from [the guidance on the GDS Wiki](https://sites.google.com/a/digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/gds/performance-management-in-gds/objective-setting-for-performance-management).

Line managers should be meeting with the line report regularly to check progress against the objectives.

## Probation period

These objectives are what we hope that our new starters are able to achieve by the end of their probation period. The standard objectives should be used once the probation period is over.

Line managers should be meeting with the line report regularly to check progress against the objectives. If it looks as though these objectives won’t be achieved the probation period can be extended.
