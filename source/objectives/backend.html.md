# Baseline objectives for backend developers on GOV.UK

These objectives attempt to lay out what we mean by a "good backend developer" on GOV.UK, and what we hope that developers on GOV.UK are aspiring to. These are the standards and behaviours need to attain a performance score of "Achieving".

These objectives are a starting point for line managers and should be modified to reflect the work of the team. The format for the objectives is taken from [the guidance on the GDS Wiki](https://sites.google.com/a/digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/gds/performance-management-in-gds/objective-setting-for-performance-management).

Line managers should be meeting with the line report regularly to check progress against the objectives.
