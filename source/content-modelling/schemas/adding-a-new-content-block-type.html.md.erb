# Adding a new content block type

To add a new content block type, follow the instructions below:

## Add the new type to Content Data API

We need to add the new type to the `no_content` Parser as they do not need frontend Parsers, [as in this commit](https://github.com/alphagov/content-data-api/commit/e02a85381dac95a7a08964e81587a1b49e384554)

## Open a pull request

Once these changes are made, open a pull request to Content Data API and get it approved

## Create a new schema in Publishing API

Follow steps 1 to 5 in the [instructions in Publishing API for adding a new schema](https://github.com/alphagov/publishing-api/blob/main/docs/content_schemas/adding-a-new-schema.md)

**NOTE:** Schemas MUST be prefixed with `content_block_*` for Content Block Manager to pick them up.

If a content block type has embedded objects, you can use the `embedded_object` helper, which ensures that all embedded
objects have a title and a key to ensure they can be referenced correctly ([Example here](https://github.com/alphagov/publishing-api/blob/9d4ce614ee3e95e82e5399201e4315ec9625e152/content_schemas/formats/content_block_pension.jsonnet#L13))

## Add expansion rules for your new schema

A good example is in [this commit](https://github.com/alphagov/publishing-api/commit/ae69bd878c87d475ace819acc6b7d76b60f5c360). Failure
to do this will mean that updates to content will not get picked up when changes are made

## Open a pull request

Once these changes are made, open a pull request to Publishing API and get it approved

## Add the schema to Content Block Manager

Update the [`VALID_SCHEMAS` constant](https://github.com/alphagov/whitehall/blob/65a5c382d64466d666317b0eee8957c98b27b276/lib/engines/content_block_manager/app/models/content_block_manager/content_block/schema.rb#L6)
in Content Block Manager (and, if necessary, the [`valid_schemas` method](https://github.com/alphagov/whitehall/blob/65a5c382d64466d666317b0eee8957c98b27b276/lib/engines/content_block_manager/app/models/content_block_manager/content_block/schema.rb#L12C13-L12C26)).

## Add any customisations

There is a [config file](https://github.com/alphagov/whitehall/blob/main/lib/engines/content_block_manager/config/content_block_manager.yml)
which allows you to configure how the schema is presented in Content Block Manager.

[See all available configuration variables](https://github.com/alphagov/whitehall/blob/main/docs/content_block_manager/configuration.md)

## Open another pull request

Once these changes are made, open pull request to Whitehall and get these changes approved

## Optional: Add a presenter to Content Block Tools

If there are any custom behaviours required for a content block, you can add a presenter to the
[Content Block Tools gem](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_content_block_tools).

You can see [an example presenter here](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_content_block_tools/blob/main/lib/content_block_tools/presenters/pension_presenter.rb).
