# Create a new environment

To create a new environment, you must:

- create secrets for the new environment
- create a new empty environment
- deploy the Terraform modules
- check the environment is working

## Create secrets for the new environment

Copy the secrets from an existing environment, for example by running [the `copy_sm_secrets.py` transfer script](https://gist.github.com/theseanything/1bb8add0077d3a2f5d979c12c6b9f140) with the following aws-cli profile names:

- `--src-profile`, the existing environment to copy the secrets from
- `--dst-profile`, the new environment to copy the secrets to

You can edit the copied secrets for the new environment using the AWS console for Secrets Manager.

## Create a new cluster

1. Run `export ENV=<ENVIRONMENT>` in the command line to define the type of environment youâ€™re creating.

    `<ENVIRONMENT>` can be `test`, `staging`, `integration` or `production`.

1. Create the Terraform state file and store it in an S3 bucket in your new AWS account:

    ```
    gds aws govuk-${ENV?}-admin -- terraform init -backend-config=${ENV?}.backend -reconfigure -upgrade
    ```

1. Update your AWS account to match the Terraform state file and create the new environment:

    ```
    gds aws govuk-${ENV?}-admin -- terraform apply -var-file ../variables/common.tfvars -var-file ../variables/${ENV?}/common.tfvars
    ```

## Deploy the Terraform modules

Deploy the Terraform root modules in order.

### 1. Deploy the `ecr` module

[Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR)](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/what-is-ecr.html) stores [container images](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/) for the GOV.UK Kubernetes platform.

The [`ecr` module](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-infrastructure/tree/main/terraform/deployments/ecr) creates the ECR for the new environment.

1. In the command line, go to the `govuk-infrastructure/terraform/deployments/ecr/` folder on your local machine.

1. Run the following to deploy the `ecr` module:

    ```
    gds aws govuk-<ENVIRONMENT>-admin -- \
      terraform init -backend-config <ENVIRONMENT>.backend -reconfigure -upgrade

    gds aws govuk-<ENVIRONMENT>-admin -- \
      terraform apply -var-file ../variables/<ENVIRONMENT>/ecr.tfvars
    ```

    `<ENVIRONMENT>` is the environment type you defined in the earlier step.

### 2. Deploy the `cluster-infrastructure` module

The [`cluster-infrastructure` module](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-infrastructure/tree/main/terraform/deployments/cluster-infrastructure) creates the AWS resources for the GOV.UK Kubernetes platform [Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/components/).

1. In the command line, go to `govuk-infrastructure/terraform/deployments/cluster-infrastructure/` on your local machine.

1. Run the following to create the AWS resources for the EKS cluster:

    ```
    gds aws govuk-<ENVIRONMENT>-admin -- \
      terraform init -backend-config <ENVIRONMENT>.backend -reconfigure -upgrade

    gds aws govuk-<ENVIRONMENT>-admin -- \
      terraform apply
    ```

    `<ENVIRONMENT>` is the environment type you defined in the earlier step.

#### Delete the `aws-auth` configmap

Creating the AWS resources for the EKS cluster also creates a default `aws-auth` configmap.

This configmap does not work with the GOV.UK Kubernetes configuration. You must delete the configmap for the new environment to work.

Run the following to delete the `aws-auth` configmap:

```
gds aws govuk-${ENV?}-admin -- aws eks update-kubeconfig --name govuk && kubectl -n kube-system delete cm aws-auth
```

### 3. Deploy the `govuk-publishing-infrastructure` module

The [`govuk-publishing-infrastructure` module](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-infrastructure/tree/main/terraform/deployments/govuk-publishing-infrastructure) creates and manages AWS resources for the GOV.UK apps where we are not yet able to manage those resources using Kubernetes.

1. In the command line, go to `govuk-infrastructure/terraform/deployments/govuk-publishing-infrastructure/` on your local machine.

1. Run the following to deploy the `govuk-publishing-infrastructure` module:

    ```
    gds aws govuk-<ENVIRONMENT>-admin -- \
      terraform init -backend-config <ENVIRONMENT>.backend -reconfigure -upgrade

    gds aws govuk-<ENVIRONMENT>-admin -- \
      terraform apply
    ```

    `<ENVIRONMENT>` is the environment type you defined in the earlier step.

### 4. Deploy the `cluster-services` module

The [`cluster-services` module](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-infrastructure/blob/main/terraform/deployments/cluster-services) deploys the [services that enable GOV.UK](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-infrastructure/tree/main/terraform/deployments/cluster-services) into the cluster.

1. In the command line, go to `govuk-infrastructure/terraform/deployments/cluster-services/` on your local machine.

1. Run the following to deploy the `cluster-services` module:

    ```
    gds aws govuk-<ENVIRONMENT>-admin -- \
      terraform init -backend-config <ENVIRONMENT>.backend -reconfigure -upgrade

    gds aws govuk-<ENVIRONMENT>-admin -- \
      terraform apply
    ```

    `<ENVIRONMENT>` is the environment type you defined in the earlier step.

## Check the environment is working

You should now have successfully created a new environment on the GOV.UK Kubernetes platform.

To check the environment is working, go to the new environment URL endpoint at `https://www.eks.<ENVIRONMENT>.govuk.digital`. For example, the endpoint for a new production environment is `https://www.eks.production.govuk.digital`.

You must be in the office or on the VPN to access this endpoint.

If the environment URL endpoint is not behaving as expected or shows an error, contact [#govuk-platform-engineering team].

## Supporting information

When you create the new environment, the process will also create an instance of the [Kubescape tool](https://github.com/armosec/kubescape) to track vulnerabilities and other metrics.

See the [Kubescape user hub](https://hub.armosec.io/docs/welcome-to-kubescape-user-hub) for more information.

See also the [Kubernetes conceptual overview documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/) for more information on Kubernetes overall.
