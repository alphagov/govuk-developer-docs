# How apps are deployed

We deploy a GOV.UK app to the GOV.UK Kubernetes platform as a set of [Kubernetes resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/).

Examples of resources include a deployment, a service, or an ingress. A [deployment](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/) resource creates Pods that run the underlying app containers.

[Helm charts](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/) group and describe Kubernetes resources. We define and store GOV.UK app Helm charts in the [`govuk-helm-charts` repo](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-helm-charts).

We use [Argo CD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to automate the deployment of our Helm charts.

Argo CD does not use the Helm tool to interact with the Kubernetes cluster. Argo CD instead uses the Helm template to generate a set of resource configurations and applies the changes to the cluster directly.

Argo CD continuously monitors Kubernetes and the `govuk-helm-charts` repo to make sure they stay in sync. The `govuk-helm-charts` repo is the source of truth.

An [Argo Application](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/declarative-setup/#applications) represents a deployed Helm chart in a particular environment. We define an Argo Application for each of the GOV.UK apps.

Each of these Argo Applications are created and managed by a parent Argo Application. This is known as an [App of Apps](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/declarative-setup/#app-of-apps).

In the `govuk-helm-charts` repo, the [`app-config` Helm chart](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-helm-charts/tree/main/charts/app-config) defines the Argo Application that defines our other Argo Applications.

## Deploying a release of a GOV.UK app

A release is a tagged commit that represents a deployable version of the code for an app. Typically, the continuous integration (CI) pipeline will build a container image for that release and tag the image with the associated Git commit simple hashing algorithm (SHA).

The deployment process is as follows.

1. To deploy a release, you update the [image tag reference](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-helm-charts/tree/main/charts/app-config/image-tags) in the `govuk-helm-charts` repo.

1. An [Argo CD PreSync hook](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/resource_hooks/) pre-compiles the assets and uploads them to S3 as a Kubernetes Job. This PreSync hook occurs before the main [Sync operation](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-guide/sync-options/) that updates the application containers.

1. A [Kubernetes Job](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-helm-charts/blob/main/charts/generic-govuk-app/templates/dbmigration-job.yaml) runs database migration as part of the Sync operation.

     We do not guarantee the database migrations will occur before the new containers access the database. As best practice database migrations should be forward and backwards compatible by one version.

1. Argo CD updates the Kubernetes deployment with the new image tag. Kubernetes then co-ordinates the deployment by creating new application containers using the new image tag and cleans up the old containers.

After the Sync operation, Argo CD triggers the [post-sync Argo Workflow](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-helm-charts/blob/main/charts/argo-workflows/templates/post-sync-workflow.yaml) to run [smokey tests](https://github.com/alphagov/smokey) for the app.

## Continuous deployment of a release of a GOV.UK app

The continuous deployment (CD) process is an automatic deployment process. A release of a GOV.UK app triggers the CD process, for example when we merge a pull request.

A new release is automatically generated by our continuous integration (CI) pipeline when a user or process adds a new successful commit to the main branch. CI builds the new image and pushes that new image to AWS Elastic Container Repository (ECR).

CI then updates the image tag value for integration in the [govuk-helm-charts repo](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-helm-charts/tree/main/charts/app-config/image-tags/integration) for the new release.

Argo CD automatically deploys the new release to the integration environment and then runs the smokey tests for the app in integration.

If the smokey tests are successful in integration, the post-sync Argo Workflow will continue and [update the image tag](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-helm-charts/blob/main/charts/argo-workflows/templates/update-image-tag.yaml) for the next environment. Argo CD deploys the release to the staging environment and runs smokey tests in staging.

If the smokey tests are successful in staging, the post-sync Argo Workflow will continue and [update the image tag](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-helm-charts/blob/main/charts/argo-workflows/templates/update-image-tag.yaml) for the next environment. Argo CD deploys the release to the production environment and runs the smokey test in production.

When the [post-sync Argo Workflow](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-helm-charts/blob/main/charts/argo-workflows/templates/update-image-tag.yaml) updates the image tag value, it creates and merges a branch into the main branch for the `govuk-helm-charts` repo without raising a pull request.

Join the [#govuk-deploy-alerts Slack channel](https://gds.slack.com/archives/C01EE7US9R6) to get a notification when an app is deployed and whether the deployment succeeded or failed.

If your app deployment failed, you should check the Argo CD logs to see why.

## Check the Argo CD logs

You must sign into Argo CD to view the Argo CD logs.

The environment you need to sign into depends on where the app deployment failed.

### Check the Argo CD integration environment

If your app deployment failed in integration, sign into the [Argo CD integration environment](https://argo.eks.integration.govuk.digital/) using your GitHub account.

To sign into integration, your GitHub account must be part of the [GOV.UK team on alphagov](https://github.com/orgs/alphagov/teams/gov-uk).

### Check the Argo CD staging and production environments

If your app deployment failed in staging or production, sign into the [Argo CD staging environment](https://argo.eks.staging.govuk.digital/) or [Argo CD production environment](https://argo.eks.production.govuk.digital/) using your GitHub account.

To sign into staging or production, your GitHub account must be part of the [GOV.UK production team on alphagov](https://github.com/orgs/alphagov/teams/gov-uk-production).

See the [documentation on getting production access](https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/manual/rules-for-getting-production-access.html) for more information.
