# Get started

To start using the GOV.UK Kubernetes platform, you should:

- try the [tutorials](tutorials)
- [set up the necessary tools](set-up-tools)
- check that you can [access the Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) clusters](access-eks-cluster)

Please note that the tutorials do not require any set up of the tools.
