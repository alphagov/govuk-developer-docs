# Before you start

To start using the GOV.UK Kubernetes platform, you must complete the [getting started on GOV.UK guidance](https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/manual/get-started.html), except for the following steps:

- [set up GOV.UK Docker](https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/manual/get-started.html#5-set-up-gov-uk-docker)
- [get SSH access to integration](https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/manual/get-started.html#6-get-ssh-access-to-integration)

You should also read the [Kubernetes overview documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/what-is-kubernetes/) to understand the fundamental concepts of Kubernetes.
