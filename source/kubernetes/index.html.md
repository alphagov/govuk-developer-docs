# GOV.UK Internal Platform

The GOV.UK Internal Platform is a centralised platform where teams can build, deploy, and manage applications in a reliable and secure environment.

This documentation is for both platform users and internal team members. It provides guides, tools, and best practices to help onboard, manage, and troubleshoot applications efficiently.

## User Guide

This section is for application developers using the platform. The platform intends to reduce cognitive load by abstracting infrastructure complexity and providing tools, guides, and automated workflows.
