# GOV.UK Internal Developer Platform

The GOV.UK Internal Developer Platform is a centralised platform where teams can build, deploy, and manage applications in a reliable and secure environment.

This documentation is for both platform users and internal team members. It provides guides, tools, and best practices to help onboard, manage, and troubleshoot applications efficiently.

## Who this guide is for

This documentation is for:

- **Developers and engineers**: Deploying and managing applications on the platform.
- **Platform engineers and administrators**: Maintaining and extending the platform.

## User Guide

This section is for application developers using the platform. The platform reduces cognitive load by abstracting infrastructure complexity and providing tools, guides, and automated workflows.

If something is missing, let us know, and weâ€™ll add an article. If you're comfortable contributing, pull requests (PRs) are welcome.
