title: Applications on GOV.UK
---

The publishing platform of GOV.UK consists of at least <%= active_app_pages.size %>
separate applications. Most of them are built using [Ruby on Rails][rails].

## Hosting

| Hosting | Count | Applications |
| --- | --- | --- |
<% Applications::hosters_descending.each do |id, name| %>
| <%= name %> | <%= Applications::apps_on_host(id).count %> | <%= Applications::apps_on_host(id).map { |app| "[#{app.app_name}](/apps/#{app.app_name}.html)" }.join(", ") %> |
<% end %>

## Reuse this data

You can [download this data as JSON](/apps.json), or [download this data as CSV](/apps.csv).
In Google Spreadsheets, use the following formula to import all of the data:

```
=importData("https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/apps.csv")
```

## Infrastructure

Applications are hosted on an infrastructure [configured using puppet][govuk-puppet].
They are deployed using [capistrano scripts][govuk-app-deployment].

## Frontend apps

Frontend apps render content to visitors to [www.gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/).
For example, a [HMRC manual page][hmrc-manual] is rendered by an application called
[manuals-frontend][manuals-frontend].

You can use the [chrome extension][extension] to find out which application
is rendering any given page.

You can [read more about the frontend architecture on GOV.UK](/manual/frontend-architecture.html).

## Publishing apps

Publishing apps are used by editors to publish content to GOV.UK. For example,
[specialist-publisher][specialist-publisher] publishes
[specialist documents][specialist documents].

The apps are secured by behind a [single signon system][signon]. They use an
[omniauth adapter called gds-sso][gds-sso] to authenticate the user.
