The publishing platform of GOV.UK consists of at least <%= active_app_pages.size %>
separate applications. Most of them are built using [Ruby on Rails][rails].

Applications are hosted on an infrastructure [configured using puppet][govuk-puppet].
They are deployed using [capistrano scripts][govuk-app-deployment].

## Frontend apps

Frontend apps render content to visitors to [www.gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/).
For example, a [HMRC manual page](hmrc-manual) is rendered by an application called
[manuals-frontend][manuals-frontend].

You can use the [chrome extension][extension] to find out which application
is rendering any given page.

All frontend applications use a [Ruby gem called slimmer][slimmer], which wraps
the generated HTML into a layout with GOV.UK styling. To avoid having to update
all applications for a global design change, slimmer pulls in the actual ERB
templates from the ["static" application][static], which also serves stylesheets,
javascript and images.

## Publishing apps

Publishing apps are used by editors to publish content to GOV.UK. For example,
[specialist-publisher][specialist-publisher] publishes
[specialist documents][specialist documents].

The apps are secured by behind a [single signon system][signon]. They use an
[omniauth adapter called gds-sso][gds-sso] to authenticate the user. The styling
of the apps are shared using [a gem called govuk\_admin\_template][govuk_admin_template].
