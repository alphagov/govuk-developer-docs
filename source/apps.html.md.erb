title: Applications on GOV.UK

# Applications on GOV.UK

GOV.UK consists of at least <%= Repos.active_apps.size %> separate applications.
Most of them are built using [Ruby on Rails][rails], hosted on an infrastructure [configured using puppet][govuk-puppet] and deployed using [capistrano scripts][govuk-app-deployment].

Each application should be owned by a team. [What application ownership means in practice][application-ownership-meaning].

Apps can be loosely grouped into different types, including:

- **APIs** provide functionality to other apps. For example, an app can publish content via Publishing API.
- **Frontend apps** render content to GOV.UK users. For example, a [HMRC manual page][hmrc-manual] is rendered by an application called [manuals-frontend][manuals-frontend]. Use the [chrome extension][extension] to find out which application is rendering any given page, and [read more about the frontend architecture on GOV.UK](/manual/frontend-architecture.html).
- **Publishing apps** are used by editors to publish content to GOV.UK. For example, [specialist-publisher][specialist-publisher] publishes [specialist documents][specialist documents]. The apps are secured by behind a [single signon system][signon].

## Apps by type

| Type | Count | Applications |
| --- | --- | --- |
<% Repos.active_apps.group_by(&:type).sort.each do |name, apps| %>
| # <%= name %> | <%= apps.count %> | <%= apps.map { |app| "[#{app.repo_name}](/repos/#{app.repo_name}.html)" }.join(", ") %> |
<% end %>

## Apps by team

| Type | Count | Applications |
| --- | --- | --- |
<% Repos.active_apps.group_by(&:team).sort.each do |name, apps| %>
| # <%= name %> | <%= apps.count %> | <%= apps.map { |app| "[#{app.repo_name}](/repos/#{app.repo_name}.html)" }.join(", ") %> |
<% end %>

## Apps by host

| Hosting | Count | Applications |
| --- | --- | --- |
<% Hosts::hosters_descending(Repos.active_apps).each do |id, label:, apps:| %>
| # <%= label %> | <%= apps.count %> | <%= apps.map { |app| "[#{app.repo_name}](/repos/#{app.repo_name}.html)" }.join(", ") %> |
<% end %>

## Reuse this data

You can download this data as JSON or as CSV. It's available for the hosted
applications ([apps.json](/apps.json) and [apps.csv](/apps.csv)) or
all the repositories ([repos.json](/repos.json) and [repos.csv](/repos.csv)).

In Google Spreadsheets, use the following formula to import all of the data:
