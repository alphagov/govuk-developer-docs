The document type describes a type of page that can exist on GOV.UK. This is different to the [content schemas][] which describe the underlying structure of a piece of content.

The document types included in these docs are pulled in automatically based on data in the [govuk_document_types repo][].

## Analysing document types

You can also [download this data as CSV](/document-types.csv). To view the current data in Google Spreadsheets, copy the following formula into a new spreadsheet:

```
=importData("https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/document-types.csv")
```

> Note: this is only a snapshot of the data and isn't kept up to date automatically.

### Using the Search API to find similar data

It's also possible to use the Search API to [query for document types][].
