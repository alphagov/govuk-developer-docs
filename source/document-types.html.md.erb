title: Document types on GOV.UK
---

The document type describes what a page on GOV.UK looks like.

> **WARNING:** All documents have a document type in the [content-store][content-store], but not
all document types have been indexed in search yet. This means some types are
missing from the list on the left. At the moment the list covers types for
<%= DocumentTypes.coverage_percentage %>% of the pages in search index.

> The data for the list is generated [by running a facet query against search][query].

## Supertypes

Document types can be grouped into "document supertypes". For example, the
whitehall document grouping splits document types into "Publications",
"Announcements" and "Statistics".

<% Supertypes.all.each do |supertype| %>
### <%= supertype.name %>

<%= supertype.description %>

Types:
<%= supertype.supertype_names.map { |name| link_to name, "https://www.gov.uk/api/search.json?filter_#{supertype.id}=#{name}" }.to_sentence %>
