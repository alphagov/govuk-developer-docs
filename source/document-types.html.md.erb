The document type describes a page on GOV.UK.

You can [download this data as CSV too](/document-types.csv) which is generated automatically based on the data in the [govuk_document_types repo][].

To view the current data in Google Spreadsheets, copy the following formula into a new spreadsheet:

```
=importData("https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/document-types.csv")
```

Note that this is only a snapshot of the data and isn't kept up to date from the CSV.
