    "body": "<div class=\"govspeak\"><h3 id=\"purpose-of-study\">Purpose of study</h3>\n\n<p>Mathematics is a creative and highly interconnected discipline that has been developed over centuries, providing the solution to some of history’s most intriguing problems. It is essential to everyday life, critical to science, technology and engineering, and necessary for financial literacy and most forms of employment. A high-quality mathematics education therefore provides a foundation for understanding the world, the ability to reason mathematically, an appreciation of the beauty and power of mathematics, and a sense of enjoyment and curiosity about the subject.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"aims\">Aims</h3>\n\n<p>The national curriculum for mathematics aims to ensure that all pupils:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>become fluent in the fundamentals of mathematics, including through varied and frequent practice with increasingly complex problems over time, so that pupils develop conceptual understanding and the ability to recall and apply knowledge rapidly and accurately</li>\n  <li>reason mathematically by following a line of enquiry, conjecturing relationships and generalisations, and developing an argument, justification or proof using mathematical language</li>\n  <li>can solve problems by applying their mathematics to a variety of routine and non-routine problems with increasing sophistication, including breaking down problems into a series of simpler steps and persevering in seeking solutions</li>\n</ul><p>Mathematics is an interconnected subject in which pupils need to be able to move fluently between representations of mathematical ideas. The programmes of study are, by necessity, organised into apparently distinct domains, but pupils should make rich connections across mathematical ideas to develop fluency, mathematical reasoning and competence in solving increasingly sophisticated problems. They should also apply their mathematical knowledge to science and other subjects.</p>\n\n<p>The expectation is that the majority of pupils will move through the programmes of study at broadly the same pace. However, decisions about when to progress should always be based on the security of pupils’ understanding and their readiness to progress to the next stage. Pupils who grasp concepts rapidly should be challenged through being offered rich and sophisticated problems before any acceleration through new content. Those who are not sufficiently fluent with earlier material should consolidate their understanding, including through additional practice, before moving on.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"information-and-communication-technology-ict\">Information and communication technology (ICT)</h3>\n\n<p>Calculators should not be used as a substitute for good written and mental arithmetic. They should therefore only be introduced near the end of key stage 2 to support pupils’ conceptual understanding and exploration of more complex number problems, if written and mental arithmetic are secure. In both primary and secondary schools, teachers should use their judgement about when ICT tools should be used.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"spoken-language\">Spoken language</h3>\n\n<p>The national curriculum for mathematics reflects the importance of spoken language in pupils’ development across the whole curriculum – cognitively, socially and linguistically. The quality and variety of language that pupils hear and speak are key factors in developing their mathematical vocabulary and presenting a mathematical justification, argument or proof. They must be assisted in making their thinking clear to themselves as well as others, and teachers should ensure that pupils build secure foundations by using discussion to probe and remedy their misconceptions.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"school-curriculum\">School curriculum</h3>\n\n<p>The programmes of study for mathematics are set out year-by-year for key stages 1 and 2. Schools are, however, only required to teach the relevant programme of study by the end of the key stage. Within each key stage, schools therefore have the flexibility to introduce content earlier or later than set out in the programme of study. In addition, schools can introduce key stage content during an earlier key stage, if appropriate. All schools are also required to set out their school curriculum for mathematics on a year-by-year basis and make this information available online.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"attainment-targets\">Attainment targets</h3>\n\n<p>By the end of each key stage, pupils are expected to know, apply and understand the matters, skills and processes specified in the relevant programme of study.</p>\n\n<div class=\"call-to-action\">\n<p>Schools are not required by law to teach the example content in [square brackets] or the content indicated as being ‘non-statutory’.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h2 id=\"key-stage-1---years-1-and-2\">Key stage 1 - years 1 and 2</h2>\n\n<p>The principal focus of mathematics teaching in key stage 1 is to ensure that pupils develop confidence and mental fluency with whole numbers, counting and place value. This should involve working with numerals, words and the 4 operations, including with practical resources [for example, concrete objects and measuring tools].</p>\n\n<p>At this stage, pupils should develop their ability to recognise, describe, draw, compare and sort different shapes and use the related vocabulary. Teaching should also involve using a range of measures to describe and compare different quantities such as length, mass, capacity/volume, time and money.</p>\n\n<p>By the end of year 2, pupils should know the number bonds to 20 and be precise in using and understanding place value. An emphasis on practice at this early stage will aid fluency.</p>\n\n<p>Pupils should read and spell mathematical vocabulary, at a level consistent with their increasing word reading and spelling knowledge at key stage 1.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"year-1-programme-of-study\">Year 1 programme of study</h2>\n\n<h3 id=\"number---number-and-place-value\">Number - number and place value</h3>\n\n<p>Pupils should be taught to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>count to and across 100, forwards and backwards, beginning with 0 or 1, or from any given number</li>\n  <li>count, read and write numbers to 100 in numerals; count in multiples of 2s, 5s and 10s</li>\n  <li>given a number, identify 1 more and 1 less</li>\n  <li>identify and represent numbers using objects and pictorial representations including the number line, and use the language of: equal to, more than, less than (fewer), most, least</li>\n  <li>read and write numbers from 1 to 20 in numerals and words</li>\n</ul><div class=\"call-to-action\">\n<h4>Notes and guidance (non-statutory)<br><br>\n</h4>\n\n<p>Pupils practise counting (1, 2, 3…), ordering (for example, first, second, third…), and to indicate a quantity (for example, 3 apples, 2 centimetres), including solving simple concrete problems, until they are fluent.<br><br>\nPupils begin to recognise place value in numbers beyond 20 by reading, writing, counting and comparing numbers up to 100, supported by objects and pictorial representations.<br><br>\nThey practise counting as reciting numbers and counting as enumerating objects, and counting in 2s, 5s and 10s from different multiples to develop their recognition of patterns in the number system (for example, odd and even numbers), including varied and frequent practice through increasingly complex questions.<br><br>\nThey recognise and create repeating patterns with objects and with shapes.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 id=\"number---addition-and-subtraction\">Number - addition and subtraction</h3>\n\n<p>Pupils should be taught to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>read, write and interpret mathematical statements involving addition (+), subtraction (−) and equals (=) signs</li>\n  <li>represent and use number bonds and related subtraction facts within 20</li>\n  <li>add and subtract one-digit and two-digit numbers to 20, including 0</li>\n  <li>solve one-step problems that involve addition and subtraction, using concrete objects and pictorial representations, and missing number problems such as 7 = ? − 9</li>\n</ul><div class=\"call-to-action\">\n<h4>Notes and guidance (non-statutory)<br><br>\n</h4>\n\n<p>Pupils memorise and reason with number bonds to 10 and 20 in several forms (for example, 9 + 7 = 16; 16 − 7 = 9; 7 = 16 − 9). They should realise the effect of adding or subtracting 0. This establishes addition and subtraction as related operations.<br><br>\nPupils combine and increase numbers, counting forwards and backwards.<br><br>\nThey discuss and solve problems in familiar practical contexts, including using quantities. Problems should include the terms: put together, add, altogether, total, take away, distance between, difference between, more than and less than, so that pupils develop the concept of addition and subtraction and are enabled to use these operations flexibly.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 id=\"number---multiplication-and-division\">Number - multiplication and division</h3>\n\n<p>Pupils should be taught to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>solve one-step problems involving multiplication and division, by calculating the answer using concrete objects, pictorial representations and arrays with the support of the teacher</li>\n</ul><div class=\"call-to-action\">\n<h4>Notes and guidance (non-statutory)<br><br>\n</h4>\n\n<p>Through grouping and sharing small quantities, pupils begin to understand: multiplication and division; doubling numbers and quantities; and finding simple fractions of objects, numbers and quantities.<br><br>\nThey make connections between arrays, number patterns, and counting in 2s, 5s and 10s.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 id=\"number---fractions\">Number - fractions</h3>\n\n<p>Pupils should be taught to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>recognise, find and name a half as 1 of 2 equal parts of an object, shape or quantity</li>\n  <li>recognise, find and name a quarter as 1 of 4 equal parts of an object, shape or quantity</li>\n</ul><div class=\"call-to-action\">\n<h4>Notes and guidance (non-statutory)<br><br>\n</h4>\n\n<p>Pupils are taught half and quarter as ‘fractions of’ discrete and continuous quantities by solving problems using shapes, objects and quantities. For example, they could recognise and find half a length, quantity, set of objects or shape. Pupils connect halves and quarters to the equal sharing and grouping of sets of objects and to measures, as well as recognising and combining halves and quarters as parts of a whole.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 id=\"measurement\">Measurement</h3>\n\n<p>Pupils should be taught to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>compare, describe and solve practical problems for: \n    <ul>\n<li>lengths and heights [for example, long/short, longer/shorter, tall/short, double/half]</li>\n      <li>mass/weight [for example, heavy/light, heavier than, lighter than]</li>\n      <li>capacity and volume [for example, full/empty, more than, less than, half, half full, quarter]</li>\n      <li>time [for example, quicker, slower, earlier, later]</li>\n    </ul>\n</li>\n  <li>measure and begin to record the following:\n    <ul>\n<li>lengths and heights</li>\n      <li>mass/weight</li>\n      <li>capacity and volume</li>\n      <li>time (hours, minutes, seconds)</li>\n      <li>recognise and know the value of different denominations of coins and notes</li>\n      <li>sequence events in chronological order using language [for example, before and after, next, first, today, yesterday, tomorrow, morning, afternoon and evening]</li>\n    </ul>\n</li>\n  <li>recognise and use language relating to dates, including days of the week, weeks, months and years</li>\n  <li>tell the time to the hour and half past the hour and draw the hands on a clock face to show these times</li>\n</ul><div class=\"call-to-action\">\n<h4>Notes and guidance (non-statutory)<br><br>\n</h4>\n\n<p>The pairs of terms: mass and weight, volume and capacity, are used interchangeably at this stage.<br><br>\nPupils move from using and comparing different types of quantities and measures using non-standard units, including discrete (for example, counting) and continuous (for example, liquid) measurement, to using manageable common standard units.<br><br>\nIn order to become familiar with standard measures, pupils begin to use measuring tools such as a ruler, weighing scales and containers.<br><br>\nPupils use the language of time, including telling the time throughout the day, first using o’clock and then half past.</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3 id=\"geometry---properties-of-shapes\">Geometry - properties of shapes</h3>\n\n<p>Pupils should be taught to:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>recognise and name common 2-D and 3-D shapes, including:\n    <ul>\n<li>2-D shapes [for example, rectangles (including squares), circles and triangles]</li>\n      <li>3-D shapes [for example, cuboids (including cubes), pyramids and spheres]</li>\n    </ul>\n</li>\n</ul><div class=\"call-to-action\">\n<h4>Notes and guidance (non-statutory)<br><br>\n</h4>\n\n<p>Pupils handle common 2-D and 3-D shapes, naming these and related everyday objects fluently.

They count in multiples of 3 to support their later understanding of a third.<br><br>\nAs they become more confident with numbers up to 100, pupils are introduced to larger numbers to develop further their recognition of patterns within the number system and represent them in different ways, including spatial representations.<br><br>\nPupils should partition numbers in different ways (for example, 23 = 20 + 3 and 23 = 10 + 13) to support subtraction. They become fluent and apply their knowledge of numbers to reason with, discuss and solve problems that emphasise the value of each digit in two-digit numbers.

    "body": "<div class=\"govspeak\"><h2 id=\"executive-summary\">\n<span class=\"number\">1. </span>Executive summary</h2>\n\n<p>This is a Budget that puts security first. It ensures economic security for working people by putting the public finances in order and setting out a bold plan for a more productive, balanced economy. It supports national security by investment in defence. It sets out bold reforms on tax and welfare, and introduces a National Living Wage so we move Britain from a low wage, high tax, high welfare economy to a higher wage, lower tax, lower welfare economy. It delivers on the promises on which the government was elected.</p>\n\n<p>Since 2010, the government has pursued a long-term economic plan that has halved the deficit as a share of <abbr title=\"Gross Domestic Product\">GDP</abbr>. For the first time since 2001-02, the national debt is falling in 2015‑16, meeting the target set out in 2010. The UK was the fastest growing <abbr title=\"A group of 7 major industrial nations (comprising: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, UK and US)\">G7</abbr> economy in 2014, employment has reached record levels, and wages are rising above inflation.</p>\n\n<p>But the job is not yet done. At 4.9%, the deficit remains too high, and productivity remains too low. The economy is still too unbalanced, and more needs to be done to build up the nations and regions of the UK, and to close the productivity gap between the north and south. The welfare bill is too high, and the welfare system traps too many people in benefit dependency. And for too long, the government has addressed low pay by subsidising it through the tax credit system, instead of delivering lower business taxes and asking business to pay higher wages.</p>\n\n<p>This Budget sets out the action the government will take to: </p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>eliminate the deficit and run an overall surplus to start paying down debt, while increasing spending on defence and the NHS</li>\n  <li>reward work and back aspiration, by introducing a new National Living Wage, cutting taxes so people can keep more of what they earn, and reforming the welfare system to make it more affordable and fair to the taxpayers who pay for it </li>\n  <li>back business and make the economy more productive, by cutting corporation tax and increasing the permanent level of the Annual Investment Allowance, and by undertaking major reform of funding for skills and infrastructure to ensure higher standards of living for everyone in the UK</li>\n  <li>secure a truly national recovery, by devolving powers and budgets to build a Northern Powerhouse, and create the right conditions for strong growth throughout the UK</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"fixing-the-public-finances-and-running-a-surplus\">\n<span class=\"number\">1.1 </span>Fixing the public finances and running a surplus</h3>\n\n<p>The government’s long-term economic plan has laid the foundations for a stronger economy, and the UK’s recovery is now well established. The labour market remains strong, and in the 3 months to April 2015, employment was around record levels at 31.1 million. </p>\n\n<p>Earnings growth is continuing to strengthen, with earnings up 2.7% over the year in the 3 months to April 2015. Living standards are forecast to be higher in 2015 than they were in 2010, and are expected to continue to grow over the forecast period.</p>\n\n<p>However, Britain is still running a 4.9% deficit, and debt is above 80% of <abbr title=\"Gross Domestic Product\">GDP</abbr>. As seen in recent weeks, the risks from abroad, not least within the euro area, demonstrate the need to secure the UK’s economic recovery.</p>\n\n<p>The government will continue to reduce the deficit by around 1.1% of <abbr title=\"Gross Domestic Product\">GDP</abbr> a year on average, the same pace as over the last Parliament. This fiscal path means that the deficit falls smoothly, and that debt falls as a share of <abbr title=\"Gross Domestic Product\">GDP</abbr> in every year of the Parliament. At the same time, the government will ensure that the UK spends 2% of <abbr title=\"Gross Domestic Product\">GDP</abbr> a year on defence for the rest of the decade, and that spending on the NHS in England increases by £10 billion per annum in real terms by 2020-21. As a result of this plan, a surplus will be achieved in 2019-20, and debt as a share of <abbr title=\"Gross Domestic Product\">GDP</abbr> in that year is forecast to be lower than expected at March Budget 2015. New fiscal rules will cement this fiscal path, and ensure that governments run surpluses in normal times. </p>\n\n<p>To achieve the surplus in 2019-20 the government will undertake around £37 billion of further consolidation measures. This Budget sets out around £17 billion of measures that will reduce the deficit, including £12 billion by 2019-20 from welfare reform and £5 billion by 2019-20 from tackling tax avoidance and tax planning, evasion and compliance, and imbalances in the tax system. In the autumn, the government will set out plans to deliver the remaining £20 billion of consolidation measures required to achieve the surplus following a rigorous Spending Review process.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"economic-forecast\">\n<span class=\"number\">1.2 </span>Economic forecast</h3>\n\n<p>The Office for Budget Responsibility (<abbr title=\"Office for Budget Responsibility\">OBR</abbr>) forecasts <abbr title=\"Gross Domestic Product\">GDP</abbr> growth of 2.4% in 2015, 2.3% in 2016, and 2.4% for the remainder of the forecast period. </p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Office for Budget Responsibility\">OBR</abbr> forecasts employment to be 31.2 million in 2015, rising each year to 32.1 million in 2020. </p>\n\n<p><abbr title=\"Consumer Prices Index\">CPI</abbr> inflation is forecast to be below target in 2015, returning gradually to 2.0% in 2020.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"fiscal-forecast\">\n<span class=\"number\">1.3 </span>Fiscal forecast</h3>\n\n<p>Public sector net borrowing is forecast to fall to 3.7% <abbr title=\"Gross Domestic Product\">GDP</abbr> in 2015-16 and then to fall each year. The <abbr title=\"Office for Budget Responsibility\">OBR</abbr> forecasts that the public finances will return a surplus of £10 billion in 2019-20.</p>\n\n<p>Public sector net debt is forecast to peak at 80.8% of <abbr title=\"Gross Domestic Product\">GDP</abbr> in 2014-19, before falling each year and reaching 68.5% of <abbr title=\"Gross Domestic Product\">GDP</abbr> in 2020-21.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rewarding-work-and-supporting-aspiration\">\n<span class=\"number\">1.4 </span>Rewarding work and supporting aspiration</h3>\n\n<p>Underpinning the government’s approach is a commitment to reward work and support aspiration. This Budget ensures that the welfare system is fair to taxpayers while supporting the most vulnerable, and builds an economy based on higher pay, lower taxes and lower welfare. It ensures that the richest are paying a greater share of tax than they were at the start of the last Parliament, whilst the poorest continue to receive the bigger share of spending.</p>\n\n<p>This Budget:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>introduces a new National Living Wage for workers aged 25 and above, and asks the Low Pay Commission to set out how it will reach 60% of median earnings by 2020; based on <abbr title=\"Office for Budget Responsibility\">OBR</abbr> forecasts, this means that the National Living Wage will reach the government’s target of over £9 by 2020</li>\n  <li>reduces taxes on working people by further increasing the personal allowance to £11,000 in 2016-17 and the higher rate threshold to £43,000; as a result of increases to the personal allowance announced since 2010, a typical basic rate taxpayer will be £905 better off</li>\n  <li>confirms that, from September 2017, free childcare entitlement will be doubled from 15 hours to 30 hours a week for working parents of 3 and 4 year olds</li>\n  <li>sets out the next stage of welfare reform, delivering on the government’s commitment to save £12 billion from the working-age welfare budget by 2019-20, including by freezing working-age benefits and Local Housing Allowances for 4 years, reducing rents in social housing by 1% a year for 4 years, reducing the benefit cap, and reforming tax credits and Universal Credit with support focussed on those with lower incomes </li>\n  <li>reforms the taxation of dividends by replacing the dividend tax credit with a Dividend Tax Allowance of £5,000 and setting new dividends tax rates</li>\n  <li>takes the family home out of inheritance tax for all but the wealthiest with a new transferable nil-rate band of up to £175,000 per estate when a main residence is passed to direct descendants; this means that the effective inheritance tax threshold will be £1 million</li>\n  <li>pays for this by introducing a taper to the annual allowance for pensions tax relief for those with total income over £150,000</li>\n  <li>increases the standard rate of insurance premium tax from 6% to 9.5%, and extends the time before a car needs its first MOT test from 3 years to 4 </li>\n  <li>restricts relief for mortgage interest for individual landlords to the basic rate of income tax, phased in over 4 years, limiting the advantage that these individuals currently enjoy over those purchasing their own home\nends the permanent non-domicile status </li>\n  <li>tackles tax evasion, avoidance and tax planning, increases tax compliance, and addresses imbalances in the tax system </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"backing-business-and-improving-productivity\">\n<span class=\"number\">1.5 </span>Backing business and improving productivity</h3>\n\n<p>The best way to create jobs and raise living standards over the long term is to support business and increase productivity by making it more competitive and by prioritising investment in skills and infrastructure.

The government’s fiscal responsibility has allowed monetary activism to support demand in the economy alongside repair of the financial sector. This has been supported by supply-side reform to deliver sustainable increases in standards of living. </p>\n\n<p>The UK’s economic recovery is well established.

In the 3 months to April the employment level and rate were both around record levels at 31.1 million and 73.4% respectively. The recent growth in employment predominantly reflects increases in full-time employment and those employed in high and medium-skilled occupations. Over the past year, 85% of the increase in employment has been in full-time work and 92% has been in high or medium-skilled jobs.<sup id=\"fnref:4\"><a href=\"#fn:4\" class=\"footnote\">4</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>The proportion of those who are inactive has been falling and is lower than it was before the crisis, but there are still too many working-age people who are not engaged in the labour force. Encouragingly, the increase in participation has been strong amongst women and older workers. The number of working-age women participating in the labour force has increased by over 700,000 since the beginning of the crisis. In the past year alone there have been an extra 200,000 workers aged over 50 in the labour force. </p>\n\n<p>The UK’s labour market has stood out among major advanced economies. Since the trough in the recession, the UK’s increase in employment rate has been the second largest in the <abbr title=\"A group of 7 major industrial nations (comprising: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, UK and US)\">G7</abbr> behind only Germany.<sup id=\"fnref:5\"><a href=\"#fn:5\" class=\"footnote\">5</a></sup> The UK has taken another step towards achieving the government’s full-employment ambition to have the highest employment rate in the <abbr title=\"A group of 7 major industrial nations (comprising: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, UK and US)\">G7</abbr>, having overtaken Canada in Q1 2015 to have the third highest employment rate in the <abbr title=\"A group of 7 major industrial nations (comprising: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, UK and US)\">G7</abbr>, behind Japan and Germany, as shown in Chart 1.2.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"chart-12-international-comparison-of-employment-rates\">Chart 1.2: International comparison of employment rates</h4>\n\n<figure class=\"image embedded\">\n  <div class=\"img\"><img alt=\"Chart 1.2\" src=\"https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/41309/50325-Chart-1.2.jpg\"></div>\n</figure>\n\n<h4 id=\"earnings\">Earnings</h4>\n\n<p>Earnings growth is continuing to strengthen with earnings up 2.7% over the year in the 3 months to April, the fastest growth in real wages since 2007. The <abbr title=\"Office for Budget Responsibility\">OBR</abbr> forecasts earnings to continue to rise above inflation over the forecast period, as shown in Chart 1.3<sup id=\"fnref:6\"><a href=\"#fn:6\" class=\"footnote\">6</a></sup>.

It is also the single most important determinant of average living standards and is tightly linked to the differences in wages across countries.</p>\n\n<p>A large and long-standing productivity gap exists between the UK and other major advanced economies. Output per hour in the UK was 17 percentage points below the <abbr title=\"A group of 7 major industrial nations (comprising: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, UK and US)\">G7</abbr> average, 27 percentage points below France, 28 percentage points below Germany and 31 percentage points below the US in 2013, as shown in Chart 1.4<sup id=\"fnref:7\"><a href=\"#fn:7\" class=\"footnote\">7</a></sup>. This gap existed prior to the financial crisis but, whilst the UK has not been alone in having weak productivity growth since the financial crisis and there are issues around the data, it is clear this gap has widened<sup id=\"fnref:8\"><a href=\"#fn:8\" class=\"footnote\">8</a></sup>. The recent weakness in productivity growth has also occurred alongside strong employment growth in the UK.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"chart-14-productivity-gap-with-the-uk-in-2013\">Chart 1.4: Productivity gap with the UK in 2013</h4>\n\n<figure class=\"image embedded\">\n  <div class=\"img\"><img alt=\"Chart 1.4\" src=\"https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/41311/50325-Chart-1.4.jpg\"></div>\n</figure>\n\n<p>The government is committed to reforming the UK economy to make it more productive. The government is publishing a productivity plan which tackles the UK’s serious long-term challenges, with major reforms to improve the UK’s infrastructure, tackle failures in the skills system, improve the planning system, encourage long-term finance for productive investment and give cities the governance and powers they need to succeed. Further information on the government’s plan to support productivity is set out below, in ‘Backing business and improving productivity’.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"rebalancing-the-uk-economy\">\n<span class=\"number\">2.4 </span>Rebalancing the UK economy</h3>\n\n<h4 id=\"regional-rebalancing\">Regional rebalancing</h4>\n\n<p>London is one of the world’s greatest global cities and a huge asset for the national economy, but in recent decades the UK has relied too heavily on the capital to generate growth. The UK’s continued national prosperity depends on regions and cities outside the capital doing well. The government has a comprehensive plan to rebalance the economy and strengthen every part of the UK, bringing together the great cities and counties of the north of England, and supporting other vital regional economies such as the Midlands and South West. </p>\n\n<p>Since 2010 unemployment has fallen in every region and almost two-thirds of the UK-wide increase in private sector employment can be attributed to regions outside London and the South East. Output per head in the North West, North East, West Midlands and Wales grew faster than in London in 2013. The government will go further by supporting the resurgence of strong metro-wide areas through devolution, enabling cities to work together to take responsibility for their own economic success by the creation of an elected mayor. Further information on the government’s plan is set out below, in ‘Ensuring a truly national recovery’.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"sector-rebalancing\">Sector rebalancing</h4>\n\n<p>As the recovery has become established, growth has been more broadly balanced across sectors. There has been widespread growth across all major sectors since the start of 2013. Manufacturing, construction and services all grew by 3% or more in 2014, the first time since records began in 1990. </p>\n\n<p>After falling during the crisis, recent UK growth has been more investment rich with business investment increasing as share of <abbr title=\"Gross Domestic Product\">GDP</abbr>. Real business investment has increased from 9.0% of <abbr title=\"Gross Domestic Product\">GDP</abbr> in 2010 to 10.6% of <abbr title=\"Gross Domestic Product\">GDP</abbr> in 2014 and is forecast to continue to do so. However, total investment as a share of output in 2014 was still lower in the UK than all other major advanced economies except Italy<sup id=\"fnref:9\"><a href=\"#fn:9\" class=\"footnote\">9</a></sup>. This is addressed in the productivity plan which will set out measures to encourage long-term investment in economic capital, including infrastructure, skills and knowledge.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"external-rebalancing\">External rebalancing</h4>\n\n<p>The UK is one of the most open economies in the world, with significant trade and financial links with other countries. Weak euro area growth has meant goods exports to <abbr title=\"European Union\">EU</abbr> countries have been subdued, falling by 5.3% since Q1 2008. However UK exports have continued to expand in other markets, as shown in Chart 1.5. The volume of goods exports to outside of the <abbr title=\"European Union\">EU</abbr> has increased by 24.1% since Q1 2008. The value of goods exports to the faster growing BRIC (Brazil, Russia, India, and China) economies has increased by 25.1% since Q1 2008.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"chart-15-trade-in-goods-since-2008\">Chart 1.5: Trade in goods since 2008</h4>\n\n<figure class=\"image embedded\">\n  <div class=\"img\"><img alt=\"Chart 1.5\" src=\"https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/41312/50325-Chart-1.5.jpg\"></div>\n</figure>\n\n<p>The UK’s trade balance as a share of <abbr title=\"Gross Domestic Product\">GDP</abbr> has improved slightly from -2.4% in 2010, to -2.0% in 2014 and is expected to improve further in 2015. The <abbr title=\"Office for Budget Responsibility\">OBR</abbr>’s forecast for exports and imports over the forecast period reflects the slowdown in global trade volumes that has been seen since the early 2000s<sup id=\"fnref:10\"><a href=\"#fn:10\" class=\"footnote\">10</a></sup>. For any level of world <abbr title=\"Gross Domestic Product\">GDP</abbr>, world trade is now expected to be lower and this feeds into a weaker outlook for UK trade, with other advanced economies also expecting to see lower exports in the next few years.<sup id=\"fnref:11\"><a href=\"#fn:11\" class=\"footnote\">11</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>The current account deficit was 5.9% of <abbr title=\"Gross Domestic Product\">GDP</abbr> in 2014. The income balance component of the current account has declined since early 2012, reflecting lower income received from investment abroad. Weaker euro area growth and global prospects have seen UK investments abroad yield lower returns while, in contrast, as the UK economy has continued to recover, the payments made on foreign investments in the UK have increased. the authorities remain vigilant to any risks that may emerge.</p>\n\n<p>The UK’s large current account deficit contributes to the UK running the largest combined government and current account deficits in the <abbr title=\"A group of 7 major industrial nations (comprising: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, UK and US)\">G7</abbr>, as shown in Chart 1.6. A current account deficit means the UK is a net foreign borrower and is acquiring more foreign liabilities than assets. The UK has run a persistent current account deficit for 30 years and a small deficit is sustainable with continued capital inflows. The UK’s budget deficit and debt position is in part financed by these capital inflows through purchases of UK government gilts. In comparison, countries that have higher levels of public debt but run small current account surpluses, such as Italy and Japan, are less exposed to financing risks from a shift in overseas invester sentiment. The government’s fiscal plan to complete the repair of the public finances should support a gradual narrowing of the current account deficit and reduce this exposure. </p>\n\n<h4 id=\"chart-16-combined-government-and-current-account-deficits-in-the-g7-in-2014\">Chart 1.6: Combined government and current account deficits in the <abbr title=\"A group of 7 major industrial nations (comprising: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, UK and US)\">G7</abbr> in 2014</h4>\n\n<figure class=\"image embedded\">\n  <div class=\"img\"><img alt=\"Chart 1.6\" src=\"https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/41313/50325-Chart-1.6.jpg\"></div>\n</figure>\n\n<h4 id=\"housing-market-and-households\">Housing market and households</h4>\n\n<p>House price growth has moderated over the past year, having grown strongly during early 2014, with annual house price growth slowing to 5.5% in April 2015. Meanwhile, property transactions fell during the second half of 2014 and were 3.1% lower in May 2015 than a year earlier. The <abbr title=\"Office for Budget Responsibility\">OBR</abbr> forecasts house prices to grow by 5.7% in 2015, followed by 4.1% in 2016, before rising to 5.6% in 2020. Property transactions are forecast to fall by 1.7% in 2015 before growth picks-up, peaking at 5.5% in 2018.</p>\n\n<p>Household balance sheets have continued to normalise as households have reduced their debt as a proportion of income to 145% in Q1 2015, having peaked at 169% in Q1 2008. While households take on debt over the forecast period they also accumulate assets, meaning household net wealth as a proportion of income is forecast by the <abbr title=\"Office for Budget Responsibility\">OBR</abbr> to increase from 8.3 times income in 2014 to 8.6 times income in 2020. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"global-developments\">\n<span class=\"number\">2.5 </span>Global developments</h3>\n\n<p>The strength and sustainability of the global economic recovery is key to UK economic prospects. The global economic recovery remains uneven and the risks from the world economy, not least from within the euro area, demonstrate the need to continue to fix the economy to ensure the UK can deal with risks from abroad. </p>\n\n<p>In June 2015 the <abbr title=\"Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\">OECD</abbr> revised down its global growth forecast for 2015 from 3.7% (forecast in November 2014) to 3.1%, with the global recovery gaining momentum but slowly<sup id=\"fnref:12\"><a href=\"#fn:12\" class=\"footnote\">12</a></sup>. The <abbr title=\"Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\">OECD</abbr> revised down its forecast for US growth in 2015 from 3.1%, forecast in its March interim forecast, to 2.0%, while the euro area growth forecast was left unchanged at 1.4% in 2015. China’s growth is expected to moderate and to fall below 7% in 2015 to 6.8%. </p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"International Monetary Fund\">IMF</abbr> last updated its economic forecast in April 2015 and forecast global growth at 3.5% in 2015<sup id=\"fnref:13\"><a href=\"#fn:13\" class=\"footnote\">13</a></sup>. The <abbr title=\"International Monetary Fund\">IMF</abbr>’s forecast included a marked shift in prospects across countries, with upward revisions in the euro area, Japan and India, and downward revisions for some emerging markets and the US. The <abbr title=\"International Monetary Fund\">IMF</abbr> will publish its revised global growth forecast on 9 July and the forecast will reflect developments over Q1 2015. Euro area growth in Q1 2015 was 0.4%, though the recovery remains vulnerable<sup id=\"fnref:14\"><a href=\"#fn:14\" class=\"footnote\">14</a></sup>. The US 2015 growth forecast was revised down in the <abbr title=\"International Monetary Fund\">IMF</abbr>’s June Article IV review to 2.5%, in light of weak Q1 2015 data.<sup id=\"fnref:15\"><a href=\"#fn:15\" class=\"footnote\">15</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>A number of other downside risks to the global recovery remain, including:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the clear risk that the ongoing situation in Greece spills over, causing renewed instability</li>\n  <li>the risk of renewed weakness in growth and inflation in the euro area </li>\n  <li>the risks posed to emerging markets with weak fundamentals from US rate rises and dollar appreciation </li>\n  <li>an escalation of geopolitical risks</li>\n  <li>the challenge for China in undertaking reform while maintaining financial stability</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The financial crisis in Greece is the biggest single external risk to the UK economy. It is vital that the current uncertainty is resolved, to ensure economic and financial stability across Europe. Britain will be more affected the longer the Greek crisis lasts, and the worse it gets. The government will do whatever is necessary to protect the UK’s economic security at this uncertain time. </p>\n\n<p>To deliver prosperity and security for all, the <abbr title=\"European Union\">EU</abbr> needs to be dynamic and outward focused, putting its resources to the most effective use. It must empower businesses to compete more effectively internationally by accelerating the integration of the single market, especially in services, and the financial, digital and energy sectors. Part of this would be the strengthening of the regulatory framework for business, improving the quality of regulation, and reducing excessive regulatory burdens on business. The <abbr title=\"European Union\">EU</abbr> also needs to be open to international trade and complete free-trade agreements with the US, Japan, and other developed economies, whilst also looking towards important new trading partners in Asia and South America.</p>\n\n<p>The government has a clear plan of reform, renegotiation and referendum, to make the <abbr title=\"European Union\">EU</abbr> a source of growth, jobs, innovation and success.

The government has ensured that monetary policy can continue to play that role fully by updating the UK’s monetary policy framework and remit for the Monetary Policy Committee (<abbr title=\"Monetary Policy Committee\">MPC</abbr>) at Budget 2013. The <abbr title=\"Monetary Policy Committee\">MPC</abbr> has full operational independence to set policy to meet the 2% inflation target as measured by the 12-month increase in the <abbr title=\"Consumer Prices Index\">CPI</abbr>.</p>\n\n<p>Inflation was 0.0% in March, triggering the second open letter for inflation falling more than 1 percentage point below target, published on 13 May 2015<sup id=\"fnref:16\"><a href=\"#fn:16\" class=\"footnote\">16</a></sup>. The low inflation recently experienced in the UK has mostly been driven by global factors, notably the sharp fall in oil prices and the decline in food prices during the second half of 2014. The Governor of the Bank of England’s open letter to the Chancellor explained that lower contributions from movements in food, energy and other goods prices accounted for around three-quarters of the shortfall in inflation from target in March.</p>\n\n<p>Inflation was -0.1% in April and 0.1% in May 2015. The <abbr title=\"Monetary Policy Committee\">MPC</abbr>’s view is that inflation is likely to remain close to its current rate over the next few months. At the time of the last open letter, the <abbr title=\"Monetary Policy Committee\">MPC</abbr> judged it likely that, conditional on interest rates following the path currently implied by market yields, slack in the economy will be absorbed and inflation will return to the 2% target within 2 years<sup id=\"fnref:17\"><a href=\"#fn:17\" class=\"footnote\">17</a></sup>.</p>\n\n<p>The Governor of the Bank of England has been clear that “a temporary period of falling prices, driven by large one-off adjustments in a few specific components of the <abbr title=\"Consumer Prices Index\">CPI</abbr> should not be mistaken for the potentially damaging process of ‘deflation’”<sup id=\"fnref:18\"><a href=\"#fn:18\" class=\"footnote\">18</a></sup>. The Chancellor has welcomed that the <abbr title=\"Monetary Policy Committee\">MPC</abbr> remains vigilant to both upside and downside risks to its forecast and stands ready to act if these risks materialise, to ensure inflation remains likely to return to target in a timely fashion.<sup id=\"fnref:19\"><a href=\"#fn:19\" class=\"footnote\">19</a></sup></p>\n\n<h4 id=\"credit-easing\">Credit easing</h4>\n\n<p>Credit conditions for businesses have continued to improve, supported by policy action the government has taken, such as through the Funding for Lending Scheme (<abbr title=\"Funding for Lending Scheme\">FLS</abbr>) and the British Business Bank. Gross lending to businesses has increased by 18% in the 5 months to May 2015 compared to the same period last year<sup id=\"fnref:20\"><a href=\"#fn:20\" class=\"footnote\">20</a></sup>. Gross lending to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) has grown by a similar amount, while net lending to SMEs is also positive so far in 2015, having increased by £0.5 billion since January 2015<sup id=\"fnref:21\"><a href=\"#fn:21\" class=\"footnote\">21</a></sup>. Survey evidence also continues to point towards improving conditions. In response to the Federation of Small Businesses Voice of Small Business Survey, more SMEs reported that credit was affordable and available than at any time since the beginning of 2012<sup id=\"fnref:22\"><a href=\"#fn:22\" class=\"footnote\">22</a></sup>.</p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Funding for Lending Scheme\">FLS</abbr> will continue to provide support for bank lending to SMEs into 2016. Since its introduction in July 2012, the scheme has contributed to a significant fall in bank funding costs and helped support the improvement in credit conditions. Net lending to SMEs by participants in the scheme was £0.6 billion in Q1 2015<sup id=\"fnref:23\"><a href=\"#fn:23\" class=\"footnote\">23</a></sup>. This was higher than the quarterly average of -£0.3 billion over 2014 and consistent with the improvement in lending across the wider market<sup id=\"fnref:24\"><a href=\"#fn:24\" class=\"footnote\">24</a></sup>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-governments-fiscal-plan\">\n<span class=\"number\">2.8 </span>The government’s fiscal plan</h3>\n\n<p>Since 2010, the government has made significant progress on reducing the deficit and repairing the public finances.

However, risks remain to the recovery, including from events in Greece and a slowing global economy.

This shows that, following the in-year savings that the government announced in June and higher tax receipts, borrowing is forecast to be £6 billion lower in 2015-16. Increased asset sales strengthen the fiscal position over the forecast period, lowering the path of debt. This has allowed the government to increase departmental spending and smooth the path of borrowing over the Parliament, while delivering a larger surplus in 2019-20 than expected in March. Borrowing will be higher in the years 2016-17 to 2018-19 by an average of £9 billion a year, but the surplus of £10 billion in 2019-20 will be £3 billion higher than was forecast in March.

Even with interest rates at historically low levels, central government gross debt interest spending equates to the budgets of the Ministry of Defence and Home Office combined in 2015-16, as set out in Table 2.3<sup id=\"fnref:29\"><a href=\"#fn:29\" class=\"footnote\">29</a></sup>. Reducing debt from its current high levels will also help prepare the UK to deal with future pressures from an ageing population.</p>\n\n<p>High debt increases the UK’s vulnerability to future shocks. Evidence suggests that at higher debt levels, the scope for fiscal policy to stabilise the economy is reduced<sup id=\"fnref:30\"><a href=\"#fn:30\" class=\"footnote\">30</a></sup>. A higher starting level of debt also increases the risk that a further shock to the public finances could increase debt to a level that the markets would view as potentially unsustainable, increasing interest rates.</p>\n\n<p>The evidence suggests that negative effects of debt are likely to start to dominate with gross debt in the region of 70-90% of <abbr title=\"Gross Domestic Product\">GDP</abbr>. Without further debt reduction, a future economic shock on the scale of the Great Recession of 2008 would take debt to well over 100% of <abbr title=\"Gross Domestic Product\">GDP</abbr><sup id=\"fnref:31\"><a href=\"#fn:31\" class=\"footnote\">31</a></sup>. This risk can be exacerbated by country-specific factors, such as potential vulnerabilities from the UK’s large current account deficit, large financial centre, and any negative feedback of high debt on growth<sup id=\"fnref:32\"><a href=\"#fn:32\" class=\"footnote\">32</a></sup>.</p>\n\n<p>A strategy for debt reduction must take into account the possibility of future economic shocks. The UK economy has been subject to relatively frequent shocks in the past and though the nature and timing are unpredictable, prudent fiscal policy should allow for them. Any analysis is necessarily illustrative, but Chart 1.7 below shows the impact on debt by 2035-36 of a simple scenario in which the economy is hit once every 8 years by a shock that increases <abbr title=\"Public Sector Net Debt\">PSND</abbr> by 10% of <abbr title=\"Gross Domestic Product\">GDP</abbr><sup id=\"fnref:33\"><a href=\"#fn:33\" class=\"footnote\">33</a></sup>. In this illustrative scenario, running a permanent 1.4% deficit (equivalent to a balanced current budget) after 2020-21 means debt only falls by 8% of <abbr title=\"Gross Domestic Product\">GDP</abbr> between its peak in 2014-15 and 2035-36. In comparison, continuing to run an overall surplus of 0.5% beyond the forecast period reduces debt by 28% of <abbr title=\"Gross Domestic Product\">GDP</abbr>.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"chart-17-public-sector-net-debt-in-2014-15-and-hm-treasury-projections-in-2035-36-under-different-policy-assumptions-with-and-without-illustrative-shocks\">Chart 1.7: Public sector net debt in 2014-15 and HM Treasury projections in 2035-36 under different policy assumptions with and without illustrative shocks</h4>\n\n<figure class=\"image embedded\">\n  <div class=\"img\"><img alt=\"Chart 1.7\" src=\"https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/41314/50325-Chart-1.7.jpg\"></div>\n</figure>\n\n<p>Any strategy for long-term debt reduction must also take into account the UK’s low inflation environment. Independent monetary policy now delivers low and stable medium-term inflation, to the benefit of the whole economy. This contrasts with the experience after World War II, when very high inflation, together with financial repression, played a major role in reducing debt<sup id=\"fnref:34\"><a href=\"#fn:34\" class=\"footnote\">34</a></sup>. Substantial debt reduction in future will depend on responsible management of the public finances and sustainable economic growth.</p>\n\n<p>The only reliable way to bring debt down to safer levels is to run a surplus in normal times<sup id=\"fnref:35\"><a href=\"#fn:35\" class=\"footnote\">35</a></sup>. Running a surplus will mean that debt falls rapidly when the economy is growing normally – ensuring that long-term debt reduction will not be knocked off-course by periodic shocks.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"charter-for-budget-responsibility\">\n<span class=\"number\">2.10 </span>Charter for Budget Responsibility</h3>\n\n<p>The government has published a draft Charter for Budget Responsibility (the “Charter”) to entrench this commitment to reach an overall surplus and maintain it in normal times. The draft Charter sets out:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>a target for a surplus on public sector net borrowing in 2019-20, and a supplementary target for public sector net debt to fall as a share of <abbr title=\"Gross Domestic Product\">GDP</abbr> in each year from 2015-16 to 2019-20</li>\n  <li>a target, once a surplus is achieved in 2019-20, to run a surplus each subsequent year as long as the economy remains in normal times</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>These targets will apply as long as the economy is not hit by a significant negative shock that reduces real <abbr title=\"Gross Domestic Product\">GDP</abbr> growth to less than 1% (on a rolling 4 quarter-on-4 quarter basis). If the <abbr title=\"Office for Budget Responsibility\">OBR</abbr> judge that the economy has been hit by a shock, the surplus rule will be suspended. This will allow the automatic stabilisers to support the economy when they are needed. The framework therefore supports fiscal discipline in normal times, while ensuring that future governments will have the flexibility to respond appropriately to shocks.</p>\n\n<p>Following a shock, the government of the day will be required to set a plan to return to surplus. This plan must include appropriate fiscal targets. The framework does not prescribe what the targets should be, allowing the government of the day to respond to the circumstances. However, the targets will be voted on by the House of Commons and assessed by the <abbr title=\"Office for Budget Responsibility\">OBR</abbr>. A surplus in normal times is necessary to provide the government of the day with the fiscal space to allow appropriate action to be taken in the face of these shocks. The end goal must be to return the public finances to surplus, ensuring that long-term debt reduction continues.</p>\n\n<p>The Charter will be laid before Parliament and voted on by the House of Commons in the autumn of 2015.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"the-obrs-fiscal-forecast\">\n<span class=\"number\">2.11 </span>The <abbr title=\"Office for Budget Responsibility\">OBR</abbr>’s fiscal forecast</h3>\n\n<p>As a result of the government’s plan, the <abbr title=\"Office for Budget Responsibility\">OBR</abbr> is forecasting that the public finances will return to surplus in 2019-20.

As shown in Chart 1.9 debt is forecast to fall in every year of the Parliament, reaching 71.5% of <abbr title=\"Gross Domestic Product\">GDP</abbr> in 2019-20 (a lower level than forecast in March) and 68.5% of <abbr title=\"Gross Domestic Product\">GDP</abbr> in 2020-21.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"chart-18-public-sector-net-borrowing-level-and-annual-change-from-2009-10-to-2020-21\">Chart 1.8: Public sector net borrowing, level and annual change from 2009-10 to 2020-21</h4>\n\n<figure class=\"image embedded\">\n  <div class=\"img\"><img alt=\"Chart 1.8\" src=\"https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/41315/50325-Chart-1.8.jpg\"></div>\n</figure>\n\n<h4 id=\"chart-19-public-sector-net-debt\">Chart 1.9: Public sector net debt</h4>\n\n<figure class=\"image embedded\">\n  <div class=\"img\"><img alt=\"Chart 1.9\" src=\"https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/41316/50325-Chart-1.9.jpg\"></div>\n</figure>\n\n<h3 id=\"fixing-the-public-finances-and-returning-a-surplus\">\n<span class=\"number\">2.12 </span>Fixing the public finances and returning a surplus</h3>\n\n<p>The government has set out its fiscal plan, to consolidate at the same pace on average as the last Parliament to reach a surplus in 2019-20. This is a smoother path of consolidation than was planned in March, but will still require action in order to achieve the surplus.</p>\n\n<p>The sections below set out the measures the government will undertake over this Parliament to repair the public finances. These measures also deliver by 2019-20 the planned contributions of £5 billion from avoidance and tax planning, evasion and compliance, and imbalances in the tax system, and £12 billion from welfare. Plans to deliver the remaining consolidation will be set out in the autumn following a rigorous Spending Review process.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"tax\">Tax</h4>\n\n<p>The government believes in lower taxes, and is committed to eliminating the deficit in a way that is fair to taxpayers. The cornerstone of this commitment is to introduce into legislation a tax lock to rule out increases in the main rates of income tax, <abbr title=\"Value Added Tax\">VAT</abbr> or National Insurance over the course of this Parliament.</p>\n\n<p>This Budget addresses imbalances in the tax system in order to pay for tax reforms to support individuals and businesses. By 2017-18, 8 out of 10 working households will be better off as a result of the income tax Personal Allowance, living wage and welfare (including tax credits) changes in this Budget. On average, these households will be £130 per year better off.</p>\n\n<p>The majority of individuals and businesses pay their fair share of tax. However, there are some who fail to pay what they owe due to error or a failure to comply with their obligations as a taxpayer, and a small minority who try to evade or aggressively avoid paying the tax they should. As part of its consolidation plans, the government will raise at least an additional £5 billion a year by 2019-20 by tackling avoidance and tax planning, evasion and compliance, and by addressing imbalances in the tax system.</p>\n\n<p>Further details of measures to ensure that individuals and businesses pay what they owe, and to address imbalances in the tax system, are set out later in this chapter.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"welfare\">\n<span class=\"number\">2.13 </span>Welfare</h3>\n\n<p>The government’s welfare cap is a firm limit on welfare spending, applying to spending in Annually Managed Expenditure with the exception of the state pension and the automatic stabilisers.</p>\n\n<p>Consistent with the Charter for Budget Responsibility, the government is setting the welfare cap for this Parliament in this Budget. The welfare cap is set at the level of the <abbr title=\"Office for Budget Responsibility\">OBR</abbr>’s forecast for spending in scope of the cap. The cap therefore reflects the welfare savings announced at this Budget, and improvements in the forecast since the cap was last set at Budget 2014. By setting the cap at the level of the new forecast, the government is committing to deliver the welfare savings set out at this Budget. The forecast margin will be set at 2% of the new cap.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"table-17-welfare-cap\">Table 1.7: Welfare cap</h4>\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th> </th>\n      <th>£billion</th>\n      <th> </th>\n      <th> </th>\n      <th> </th>\n      <th> </th>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th> </th>\n      <th>2016-17</th>\n      <th>2017-18</th>\n      <th>2018-19</th>\n      <th>2019-20</th>\n      <th>2020-21</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Welfare cap</td>\n      <td>115.2</td>\n      <td>114.6</td>\n      <td>114</td>\n      <td>113.5</td>\n      <td>114.9</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Forecast margin (2%)</td>\n      <td>2.3</td>\n      <td>2.3</td>\n      <td>2.3</td>\n      <td>2.3</td>\n      <td>2.3</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n<p>Source: HM Treasury, based on Office for Budget Responsibility forecast.</p>\n\n<p>In the last Parliament, the government legislated for over £21 billion of welfare savings<sup id=\"fnref:37\"><a href=\"#fn:37\" class=\"footnote\">37</a></sup>. As the recovery takes hold, it is right that welfare savings continue to play a role in the deficit reduction plan.</p>\n\n<p>The government’s plans for reducing the working-age welfare bill are set out below. The government is reforming the welfare system to make it more affordable and fairer to taxpayers, while continuing to support the most vulnerable. As a result of measures announced in this Budget, welfare spending will be £12 billion lower in 2019-20 than would otherwise have been the case. Working-age welfare spending is now forecast to grow at -2.3% annually in real terms over the Parliament, compared to -0.6% over the last Parliament and 4.0% over the 2005-10 Parliament<sup id=\"fnref:38\"><a href=\"#fn:38\" class=\"footnote\">38</a></sup>.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"public-spending\">Public spending</h4>\n\n<p>The government has already identified a further £3 billion of departmental savings in 2015-16<sup id=\"fnref:39\"><a href=\"#fn:39\" class=\"footnote\">39</a></sup>. The departmental savings have been achieved through efficiency savings, tighter control of budgets to drive underspends in-year, and through asset sales.</p>\n\n<p>The government will set out how the remaining consolidation will be delivered in the autumn following a rigorous Spending Review process.</p>\n\n<p>The Spending Review will look at all elements of public spending in order to create a more efficient public sector, whilst continuing to prioritise growth-promoting expenditure and spending on public services for those who need them the most.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"funding-for-healthcare\">Funding for healthcare</h4>\n\n<p>The NHS ‘Five Year Forward View’ outlines a plan for a more sustainable, integrated health service that cares for people closer to home<sup id=\"fnref:40\"><a href=\"#fn:40\" class=\"footnote\">40</a></sup>.</p>\n\n<p>The Budget protects spending on the NHS in England and backs its 5-year plan. The government will continue to spend more on the NHS in real terms every year, as it has in every year since 2010. It will fully fund the NHS plan which called for £8 billion more by 2020-21. This additional funding comes on top of the £2 billion announced at Autumn Statement 2014.</p>\n\n<p>The Budget therefore commits to increase NHS funding in England by £10 billion in real terms by 2020-21, above 2014-15 levels. This additional investment will support the NHS in England to go further than its plan and to deliver a step change in safety, quality and access.</p>\n\n<p>The Five Year Forward View set out how, with the additional funding confirmed in this Budget, the NHS will deliver £22 billion in efficiency savings by 2020-21. This will come through improvements to quality of care and staff productivity, and better procurement.</p>\n\n<p>The government will ensure the NHS becomes a 7-day service by 2020-21. Hospitals will be appropriately staffed at weekends to ensure people can obtain the care they need every day of the week. Everyone will be able to access GP services from 8am – 8pm seven days a week. These improvements will allow people to better balance work, health and family and will be a key to a more productive economy.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"funding-for-defence-and-security\">Funding for defence and security</h4>\n\n<p>The first duty of government is to ensure the safety and security of the country and its people. The government remains committed to ensuring real growth of the Ministry of Defence equipment plan of 1% per year and maintaining the size of the Army at 82,000. The government will go further, and this Budget commits to raise the entire Ministry of Defence budget by 0.5% a year in real terms. This Budget also protects overall counter terrorism spending across government, a total of more than £2.0 billion spent by a range of departments, agencies, and the police.</p>\n\n<p>The threats the UK faces are diverse and require coordinated responses from the armed forces, security and counter terrorism agencies. In addition to the annual increase in the defence budget, this Budget announces up to an additional £1.5 billion a year by the end of the Parliament to fund increased spending on the military and intelligence agencies by an average of 1% a year in real terms. </p>\n\n<p>The final allocation of this additional funding will be determined by the Strategic Defence and Security Review and Spending Review, and is conditional on the armed services and agencies producing further efficiencies within their existing budgets to ensure continued investment in the most important capabilities.</p>\n\n<p>Allowing for all of the public spending that supports the Ministry of Defence and the contribution made by the secret intelligence agencies, this Budget commits the government to meet the properly measured NATO pledge to spend 2% of national income on defence every year of this decade.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"public-sector-pay-and-pensions\">Public sector pay and pensions</h4>\n\n<p>In the last Parliament, the government exercised firm restraint over public sector pay to deliver reductions to departmental spending, saving approximately £8 billion<sup id=\"fnref:41\"><a href=\"#fn:41\" class=\"footnote\">41</a></sup>. As set out by the Chancellor at Autumn Statement 2014, the government will need to continue to take tough decisions on public sector pay in order to deliver reductions to departmental spending and protect the quality of public services.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, levels of pay in the public sector are now, on average, comparable to those in the private sector. However, public sector workers continue to benefit from a significant premium once employer pension contributions are taken into account, as shown in Chart 1.10.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"chart-110-estimated-public-private-hourly-pay-differential\">Chart 1.10: Estimated public-private hourly pay differential</h4>\n\n<figure class=\"image embedded\">\n  <div class=\"img\"><img alt=\"Chart 1.10\" src=\"https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/41317/50325-Chart-1.10.jpg\"></div>\n</figure>\n\n<p>In light of this and continued low inflation, the government will therefore fund public sector workforces for a pay award of 1% for 4 years from 2016-17 onwards. This will save approximately £5 billion by 2019-20<sup id=\"fnref:42\"><a href=\"#fn:42\" class=\"footnote\">42</a></sup>. The government expects pay awards to be applied in a targeted manner within workforces to support the delivery of public services.</p>\n\n<p>As part of the forthcoming Spending Review, the government will continue to examine pay reforms and modernise the terms and conditions of public sector workers. This will include a renewed focus on reforming progression pay, and considering legislation where necessary to achieve the government’s objectives.</p>\n\n<p>The government will work with Local Government Pension Scheme administering authorities to ensure that they pool investments to significantly reduce costs, while maintaining overall investment performance.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"efficiency-and-reform\">Efficiency and reform</h4>\n\n<p>The government will continue to pursue more efficient ways of working and further reform to public services. The government will provide funding for the Cabinet Office to explore a number of cross-cutting savings proposals. The Treasury, working with Cabinet Office, will develop specific proposals to inform the Spending Review.</p>\n\n<p>At Spending Round 2013, the government announced a control total would limit payments under PFI and PF2 contracts in nominal terms in each future Parliament. As reported by the <abbr title=\"Office for Budget Responsibility\">OBR</abbr>, the Treasury is on track to meet this target, with forecast cumulative spending from 2015-16 to 2019-20 for payments on all PFI contracts funded by central government standing at £51.9 billion<sup id=\"fnref:43\"><a href=\"#fn:43\" class=\"footnote\">43</a></sup>.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"bbc\">BBC</h4>\n\n<p>The BBC has agreed to take on responsibility for funding the over-75s licence fee concession, which will help contribute to reductions in public spending. This will be phased in from 2018-19, with the full liability being met by the BBC from 2020-21. As part of these new arrangements, the government will ensure that the BBC can modernise the licence fee to cover public service broadcast catch-up television and anticipates that the licence fee will rise in line with <abbr title=\"Consumer Prices Index\">CPI</abbr> over the next Charter period, subject to Charter Review conclusions on the purposes and scope of the BBC, and the BBC demonstrating that it is undertaking efficiency savings at least equivalent to those in other parts of the public sector.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"financial-sector-and-other-state-owned-asset-sales\">Financial sector and other state-owned asset sales</h4>\n\n<p>The government is committed to returning the financial sector assets that were acquired in 2008 and 2009 to the private sector. The government will seek to dispose of other commercial and financial assets, which there is no policy reason for the government to hold, in order to maximise value for taxpayers and reduce the level of public debt. Significant progress towards this goal has already been made.</p>\n\n<p>As set out in the <abbr title=\"Office for Budget Responsibility\">OBR</abbr>’s July 2015 ‘Economic and fiscal outlook’, to date the government has made the following recoveries from financial sector interventions:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>over £40 billion through selling shares in Lloyds Banking Group, and repayments from the Royal Bank of Scotland (<abbr title=\"Royal Bank of Scotland\">RBS</abbr>), UK Asset Resolution (<abbr title=\"UK Asset Resolution Ltd\">UKAR</abbr>) and the estates of failed banks</li>\n  <li>almost £20 billion in other fees received from Lloyds, <abbr title=\"Royal Bank of Scotland\">RBS</abbr>, <abbr title=\"UK Asset Resolution Ltd\">UKAR</abbr> and other financial institutions relating to government support and participation in government intervention schemes – all of which are no longer required</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The government has also completed disposals of Eurostar (£757 million) and Royal Mail shares (£750 million) in 2015-16<sup id=\"fnref:44\"><a href=\"#fn:44\" class=\"footnote\">44</a></sup>.</p>\n\n<p>In light of independent advice, the government will begin to sell off its stake in <abbr title=\"Royal Bank of Scotland\">RBS</abbr> in the next few months<sup id=\"fnref:45\"><a href=\"#fn:45\" class=\"footnote\">45</a></sup>. Over the course of this Parliament, the government will dispose of at least three-quarters of its stake in <abbr title=\"Royal Bank of Scotland\">RBS</abbr>, starting with a sale in the coming months. The government expects to raise at least £2 billion in 2015-16. All options for near-term disposals will be considered.</p>\n\n<p>Through the ongoing Lloyds Banking Group trading plan, which was extended on 1 June 2015 for a further six months, the government has sold over £5 billion of shares, reducing the taxpayer’s stake to under 16%<sup id=\"fnref:46\"><a href=\"#fn:46\" class=\"footnote\">46</a></sup>. The government will launch a further share sale which will be open to retail investors in the next 12 months. Further details will be set out in due course.</p>\n\n<p><abbr title=\"UK Asset Resolution Ltd\">UKAR</abbr> are also on track to complete the sale of assets announced at Budget 2015 from the forced nationalisation of Northern Rock and Bradford &amp; Bingley plc, and in parallel are exploring options for the sale or outsourcing of its mortgage servicing activities.</p>\n\n<p>The government intends to complete the sale of its remaining 14% shareholding in Royal Mail by the end of 2015-16, subject to achieving value for money. This is expected to raise around £700 million.</p>\n\n<p>The government is exploring options to move the Green Investment Bank into private ownership. This will ensure the future sustainability of the bank as well as increasing its impact by freeing it from the constraints of state aid and competition for public funding.</p>\n\n<p>By the end of 2015-16 and subject to value for money, the government intends to sell its shareholding in the Kings Cross property development (valued at £345 million in the Department for Transport’s accounts) and expects to sell the first tranche of the pre-Browne income contingent repayment student loan book<sup id=\"fnref:47\"><a href=\"#fn:47\" class=\"footnote\">47</a></sup>. There is a central estimate of £12 billion for total proceeds from tranches to be sold up to 2020. The government is also continuing to work towards a sale of its 33% shareholding in Urenco.</p>\n\n<p>In 2013, the government set a target of selling £20 billion of corporate and financial assets between 2014 and 2020. With sales to date this target is over two thirds of the way to being met<sup id=\"fnref:48\"><a href=\"#fn:48\" class=\"footnote\">48</a></sup>. Sales planned for the remainder of the year mean the government expects to significantly exceed the target during 2015-16.</p>\n\n<p>Taken together, the government’s central estimate, certified by the <abbr title=\"Office for Budget Responsibility\">OBR</abbr>, is that these sales of financial and commercial assets will raise approximately £31 billion in 2015-16, achieving value for money for the taxpayer and further reducing public debt.</p>\n\n<p>Overall, planned sales for 2015-16 amount to the largest privatisation proceeds in a single year ever.

The government remains on course to meet the current fiscal mandate, with the <abbr title=\"Office for Budget Responsibility\">OBR</abbr> forecast indicating that cyclically-adjusted current budget balance will be achieved a year early in 2017-18.</p>\n\n<p>The government’s fiscal mandate is supplemented by a target for <abbr title=\"Public Sector Net Debt\">PSND</abbr> as a percentage of <abbr title=\"Gross Domestic Product\">GDP</abbr> to be falling in 2016-17. The <abbr title=\"Office for Budget Responsibility\">OBR</abbr> forecasts <abbr title=\"Public Sector Net Debt\">PSND</abbr> falls 1.1% of <abbr title=\"Gross Domestic Product\">GDP</abbr> between 2015-16 and 2016-17. Additionally, <abbr title=\"Public Sector Net Debt\">PSND</abbr> as a share of <abbr title=\"Gross Domestic Product\">GDP</abbr> will start to fall one year earlier in 2015-16.

The government is planning on the basis of sterling financing for the Official Reserves of £6 billion per year on average, over the 4 years from 2016-17 up to and including 2019-20; thereafter the government has adopted a neutral assumption.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"rewarding-work-and-backing-aspiration\">\n<span class=\"number\">3. </span>Rewarding work and backing aspiration</h2>\n\n<p>Underpinning the government’s approach is a commitment to reward work and back aspiration, while continuing to support the most vulnerable in society. This Budget builds an economy where people get a fair day’s pay for a fair day’s work by earning more and keeping more of what they earn. It ensures that welfare expenditure is controlled and that the welfare system is fair to taxpayers who pay for it.</p>\n\n<p>The Budget will support working people by introducing a new National Living Wage (NLW) to lift the wages of the lowest paid, while setting out the path to a tax-free National Minimum Wage (<abbr title=\"National Minimum Wage\">NMW</abbr>). The Budget cuts taxes so working families can keep more of what they earn by raising the personal allowance and delivering a real terms increase in the higher rate threshold of income tax for the first time since 2010. And it will take the family home out of inheritance tax for all but the wealthiest.</p>\n\n<p>The Budget reforms welfare so that it is fair both to those who need it, and those who pay for it. It makes the whole system more sustainable and rewards work.</p>\n\n<p>The Budget ensures the deficit is cut in a fair way by taking significant action to tackle tax avoidance and aggressive tax planning, tax evasion and compliance, and address imbalances in the tax system.</p>\n\n<p>The UK’s strong labour market has resulted in a substantial fall in income inequality, with inequality in original incomes (before taxes and benefits) now at its lowest point for 25 years. In addition, as a result of the decisions of this government and the previous government, the poorest fifth of households receive the same proportion of public spending (24%) as they did before consolidation. However, tax decisions have shifted the burden onto the rich: before consolidation, the richest fifth paid 49% of tax; this has increased to 52%.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"a-higher-wage-lower-tax-lower-welfare-society\">\n<span class=\"number\">3.1 </span>A higher wage, lower tax, lower welfare society</h3>\n\n<p>The government wants to move from a low wage, high tax, high welfare society to a higher wage, lower tax, lower welfare society. Over the last Parliament, those on the lowest wages saw their pay steadily rise, with the <abbr title=\"National Minimum Wage\">NMW</abbr> now standing at £6.50. Tax reforms took millions of people out of income tax and reduced income tax for millions more. Flagship welfare reforms have started to bring expenditure under control and ensure that the system rewards work. And the government is delivering on its pledge to create full employment. In the last Parliament, the Jobseeker’s Allowance claimant count reached its lowest ever level, 2 million new jobs were created and the UK recently overtook Canada to have the third highest employment rate in the <abbr title=\"A group of 7 major industrial nations (comprising: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, UK and US)\">G7</abbr>.</p>\n\n<p>With a record high of 31.1 million people now in employment, record levels of vacancies, and an economy that was the fastest growing in the <abbr title=\"A group of 7 major industrial nations (comprising: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, UK and US)\">G7</abbr> in 2014 and is forecast by the <abbr title=\"Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\">OECD</abbr> to be the fastest growing again in 2015<sup id=\"fnref:52\"><a href=\"#fn:52\" class=\"footnote\">52</a></sup>, the government will take further steps towards the vision of an economy and society where people are better paid and keep more of what they earn, instead of relying on an ever increasing benefit system.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"a-higher-wage-society-the-national-living-wage\">\n<span class=\"number\">3.2 </span>A higher wage society: the National Living Wage</h3>\n\n<p>The UK has a higher incidence of low pay than other advanced economies: 1 in 5 UK workers is low-paid, compared to an average of only 1 in 6 among <abbr title=\"Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\">OECD</abbr> countries<sup id=\"fnref:53\"><a href=\"#fn:53\" class=\"footnote\">53</a></sup>. With a strengthening economy, the government believes that now is the right time to take action to tackle low pay and ensure that lower wage workers can take a greater share of the gains from growth. </p>\n\n<p>The government will therefore introduce a new National Living Wage (NLW) for workers aged 25 and above, by introducing a new premium on top of the <abbr title=\"National Minimum Wage\">NMW</abbr>. From April 2016, the new NLW will be set at £7.20 – a rise of 70p relative to the current <abbr title=\"National Minimum Wage\">NMW</abbr> rate, and 50p above the <abbr title=\"National Minimum Wage\">NMW</abbr> increase coming into effect in October 2015.</p>\n\n<p>The government will ask the Low Pay Commission (LPC) to set out how the new NLW will reach 60% of median earnings by 2020. Based on the <abbr title=\"Office for Budget Responsibility\">OBR</abbr>’s earnings forecasts, this means that the NLW will reach the government’s target of over £9 by 2020. 60% of median earnings is in line with the approach suggested by Professor Sir George Bain, the first chair of the LPC, in a 2014 report on the future on the <abbr title=\"National Minimum Wage\">NMW</abbr>.</p>\n\n<p>This will mean a direct boost in earnings for 2.7 million low wage workers, and the <abbr title=\"Office for Budget Responsibility\">OBR</abbr> have indicated that knock-on effects further up the wage distribution could mean a further 3.25 million people also see an increase in wages as a result of the NLW. By the end of the Parliament, an individual aged over 25 working 35 hours a week and previously earning the <abbr title=\"National Minimum Wage\">NMW</abbr> will see their gross wages increase by around a third compared to 2015-16, or £5,200 in cash terms. This is equivalent to an extra £2,000 per year from the premium alone, £4,000 for a couple.</p>\n\n<p>The chart below sets out the expected profile of the NLW, based on <abbr title=\"Office for Budget Responsibility\">OBR</abbr> forecasts.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"chart-112-national-minimum-wage-and-national-living-wage-historical-and-forecast\">Chart 1.12: National Minimum Wage and National Living Wage, historical and forecast</h4>\n\n<figure class=\"image embedded\">\n  <div class=\"img\"><img alt=\"Chart 1.12\" src=\"https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/41319/50325-Chart-1.12.jpg\"></div>\n</figure>\n\n<p>Alongside the Budget, the government has published an entirely new remit for the LPC<sup id=\"fnref:54\"><a href=\"#fn:54\" class=\"footnote\">54</a></sup>. To ensure that the rate of the NLW is set at a sustainable level and continues to take account of broader economic conditions, the LPC’s remit will require it to set the NLW in a way that reflects the growth in median earnings. The LPC’s remit in relation to the <abbr title=\"National Minimum Wage\">NMW</abbr> will remain unchanged.</p>\n\n<p>For younger workers, the priority is to secure work and gain experience, which is already reflected in the existing <abbr title=\"National Minimum Wage\">NMW</abbr> rate structure. In order to maximise the opportunities for younger workers to gain that experience, the NLW will only apply to workers aged 25 and over. The wages of younger workers will continue to be underpinned by the core <abbr title=\"National Minimum Wage\">NMW</abbr>. </p>\n\n<p>The government recognises that this new NLW may increase costs for some businesses. Therefore on top of other reductions in business tax, from April 2016, the government will increase the National Insurance contributions (<abbr title=\"National Insurance contributions\">NICs</abbr>) Employment Allowance from £2,000 to £3,000 a year. This will help all businesses and charities, particularly smaller ones, with additional wage costs. As a result, up to 90,000 employers will see their employer <abbr title=\"National Insurance contributions\">NICs</abbr> liability reduced to zero. When introduced in 2014, the Employment Allowance offset the <abbr title=\"National Insurance contributions\">NICs</abbr> costs of employing 4 workers full time on the <abbr title=\"National Minimum Wage\">NMW</abbr>. The increase in the Employment Allowance will mean firms will be able to continue to employ 4 workers full time on the new NLW next year, without paying any <abbr title=\"National Insurance contributions\">NICs</abbr>. </p>\n\n<p>The further reduction in the rate of corporation tax will also cut costs for businesses, as will reforms to the Annual Investment Allowance (set out in more detail in ‘Backing business and improving productivity’). The <abbr title=\"Office for Budget Responsibility\">OBR</abbr> estimate that the increased cost to businesses from the NLW could amount to only just over 1% of corporate profits by 2020.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"the-economic-impact-of-a-national-living-wage\">The economic impact of a National Living Wage</h4>\n\n<p>The concept of setting a minimum wage target based on 60% of median earnings was set out in a recent report by the Resolution Foundation, authored by the first chair of the LPC Professor Sir George Bain, along with others including Professor Alan Manning, as part of a more ambitious approach to low pay with additional focus on the longer term impacts.<sup id=\"fnref:55\"><a href=\"#fn:55\" class=\"footnote\">55</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>The introduction of a NLW will reduce the incidence of low pay and increase the returns to entering work. There may also be an increase in costs for businesses, which could affect employment. The <abbr title=\"Office for Budget Responsibility\">OBR</abbr> assessment of the impact of the introduction of a National Living Wage, given the continued strong employment growth seen in the UK, is to have “revised up fractionally” their forecast for unemployment rate. They estimate that even after the introduction of the new NLW, employment is forecast to rise by 1.1 million in 2021 – only 60,000 lower than it would have risen without the NLW. While some empirical studies have found reductions in employment from increases in the minimum wage, these have generally been modest.<sup id=\"fnref:56\"><a href=\"#fn:56\" class=\"footnote\">56</a></sup> Other studies have been unable to find robust evidence of any negative employment effect.<sup id=\"fnref:57\"><a href=\"#fn:57\" class=\"footnote\">57</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>Indeed, in 2001, the adult minimum wage increased by 10.8% in a single year. Further strong rises in 2003 and 2004 resulted in the minimum wage increasing by 31.1% over four years. Here, the evidence suggests that there was not a large impact on employment. </p>\n\n<p>Summarising the existing research, the LPC stated in 2011 that, “The consensus of the research findings on the impact of the <abbr title=\"National Minimum Wage\">NMW</abbr> in the UK is that it has not significantly adversely affected employment but that it may have had a small negative impact on hours.” Instead firms have adjusted through other channels, by adjusting profits and pricing strategies, changing pay differentials and, in low paying sectors, boosting productivity.<sup id=\"fnref:58\"><a href=\"#fn:58\" class=\"footnote\">58</a></sup> Employers’ costs are also being lowered by other measures in the Budget, including reductions in the rate of Corporation Tax, and an increase in the Employment Allowance.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"a-lower-tax-society-cutting-taxes-for-working-people\">\n<span class=\"number\">3.3 </span>A lower tax society: cutting taxes for working people</h3>\n\n<p>Alongside action on wages, the government is supporting working people by ensuring that they can keep more of the money they earn by cutting taxes.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"income-tax\">Income tax</h4>\n\n<p>In the last Parliament, the personal allowance increased by more than 60%, from £6,475 in 2010-11 to £10,600 in 2015-16. It is delivering a tax cut for over 27 million individuals, with basic rate taxpayers being £825 better off in 2015-16 compared with 2010. As a result, 3.8 million individuals on the lowest incomes were removed from income tax altogether, addressing the merry-go-round of taking taxes off people only to repay them in benefits.</p>\n\n<p>The government wants to continue to reward work by reducing taxes and taking more people out of income tax. The government has therefore pledged to raise the personal allowance to £12,500 by the end of this parliament. This Budget takes the first step towards this commitment. In 2016-17, the personal allowance will increase by £400 to £11,000. As a result, a basic rate taxpayer will be £80 better off in 2016-17 compared to 2015‑16, and £905 better off compared with 2010. </p>\n\n<p>The government believes that people working 30 hours a week on the lowest pay (the <abbr title=\"National Minimum Wage\">NMW</abbr>) should not pay income tax. The government will therefore legislate to ensure that once the personal allowance has reached £12,500, it will always be set at least at the equivalent of 30 hours a week on the <abbr title=\"National Minimum Wage\">NMW</abbr>. This will ensure that those working up to 30 hours on the <abbr title=\"National Minimum Wage\">NMW</abbr> will not pay income tax in the future. </p>\n\n<h4 id=\"chart-113-annual-gross-salary-for-30-hours-per-week-at-national-minimum-wage-and-personal-allowance\">Chart 1.13: Annual gross salary for 30 hours per week at National Minimum Wage and Personal Allowance</h4>\n\n<figure class=\"image embedded\">\n  <div class=\"img\"><img alt=\"Chart 1.13\" src=\"https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/41320/50325-Chart-1.13.jpg\"></div>\n</figure>\n\n<p>The government wants to encourage those who aspire to progress in work. That is why the government has pledged to raise the level at which the higher rate of income tax is applied, the higher rate income threshold, to £50,000 by the end of this parliament. </p>\n\n<p>This Budget confirms the first step towards this commitment by increasing the higher rate threshold from £42,385 to £43,000 for 2016-17. This is the first time since 2010 that the higher rate threshold will go up by more than inflation alone. These changes will lift 130,000 individuals out of higher rate tax by 2016-17, compared to 2015-16. A typical higher rate taxpayer will benefit by £142 in 2016-17, and will be £818 better off compared to 2010. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"a-lower-welfare-society-reforming-the-system-to-make-it-fairer-and-more-affordable\">\n<span class=\"number\">3.4 </span>A lower welfare society: reforming the system to make it fairer and more affordable</h3>\n\n<p>In the last Parliament, the government started reforming the welfare system to make it fairer and more affordable, legislating for £21 billion of savings. Universal Credit, which brings together 6 benefits into 1, represents the most fundamental reform of welfare since its inception and will mark a turning point towards a system where work will always pay more than a life on benefits. Universal Credit is due to expand to over 500 jobcentres by the end of this year. </p>\n\n<p>However, despite progress during the last Parliament there is still more to do. Taxpayers are still being asked to pay for welfare expenditure that remains disproportionately high. 7% of global expenditure on social protection is spent in the UK, despite the fact that the UK produces 4% of global <abbr title=\"Gross Domestic Product\">GDP</abbr> and has only 1% of the world’s population. As chart 1.14 shows, spending on working-age welfare has increased significantly in real terms over the last few decades. Too many families continue to be trapped on benefits. The Budget sets out the next stage of welfare reform, delivering on the government’s commitment to save £12 billion from the working age welfare bill.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"chart-114-working-age-welfare-2014-2015-prices\">Chart 1.14: Working age welfare (2014-2015 prices)</h4>\n\n<figure class=\"image embedded\">\n  <div class=\"img\"><img alt=\"Chart 1.14\" src=\"https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/41321/50325-Chart-1.14.jpg\"></div>\n</figure>\n\n<h4 id=\"freezing-working-age-benefits\">Freezing working-age benefits</h4>\n\n<p>Since the financial crisis began in 2008, average earnings have risen by 11%, whereas most benefits, such as Jobseeker’s Allowance, have risen by 21%. To ensure that it always pays to work, and that earnings growth overtakes the growth in benefits, the government will legislate to freeze working-age benefits, including tax credits and the Local Housing Allowances, for 4 years from 2016-17 to 2019-20. This is forecast to save £4 billion a year by 2019-20.</p>\n\n<p>Statutory payments, including Maternity Allowance, Maternity Pay, Paternity Pay and Statutory Sick Pay will continue to be indexed by <abbr title=\"Consumer Prices Index\">CPI</abbr>. Disability benefits will also continue to be indexed by <abbr title=\"Consumer Prices Index\">CPI</abbr>, including Personal Independence Payment, Attendance Allowance, Disability Living Allowance and Employment and Support Allowance (Support Group).</p>\n\n<p>The government will continue to protect benefits which are specifically for pensioners. The ‘triple lock’ on the State Pension will be maintained; and other benefits for pensioners including the Winter Fuel Allowance and free TV licences for over 75s will be protected in this Parliament. Pensioners have paid into the system throughout their working lives, and are the group least able to increase their income in response to welfare reform. </p>\n\n<p>Alongside the freeze in working-age benefits, the government will reduce rents in social housing in England by 1% a year for 4 years, requiring Housing Associations and Local Authorities to deliver efficiency savings, making better use of the £13 billion annual subsidy they receive from the taxpayer. Rents in the social sector increased by 20% over the 3 years from 2010-11. This will allow social landlords to play their part in reducing the welfare bill. This will mean a 12% reduction in average rents by 2020-21 compared to current forecasts.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"making-tax-credits-and-universal-credit-fairer\">Making Tax Credits and Universal Credit fairer</h4>\n\n<p>Tax credit expenditure more than trebled in real terms between 1999-00 and 2010-11, with total expenditure in 2014-15 estimated to be around £30 billion – an increase of almost £10 billion in real terms over the last 10 years. UK expenditure on family cash benefits is the highest in the <abbr title=\"Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\">OECD</abbr>, and was double the <abbr title=\"Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\">OECD</abbr> average in 2011. 9 out of 10 families with children were eligible for tax credits in 2010. As a result of the reforms undertaken in the last Parliament, 6 out of 10 are eligible currently.</p>\n\n<p>The government believes that now is the best time to address this growing expenditure if the welfare system is to be put on a sustainable footing. Tackling tax credit spending is part of properly addressing the root causes of low pay, with the new NLW and a more generous tax system to help people earn more and keep more of what they earn, rather than addressing only the symptoms of the problem by subsidising low pay through the benefit system.</p>\n\n<p>The Budget will therefore reform the tax credits system (and its successor, Universal Credit) to protect existing families on the lowest incomes while favouring support to working families through the tax system and earnings growth, rather than the benefit system. </p>\n\n<p>From April 2016, the government will reduce the level of earnings at which a household’s tax credits and Universal Credit award starts to be withdrawn for every extra pound earned. In tax credits, this point (known as the income threshold) will be reduced from £6,420 to £3,850. The equivalents in Universal Credit (work allowances) will be reduced to £4,764 for those without housing costs, £2,304 for those with housing costs, and removed altogether for non-disabled claimants without children. The government will also increase the rate at which a person’s or household’s tax credit award is reduced as they progress in work, by increasing the taper rate in tax credits from 41% to 48%.</p>\n\n<p>The Budget will also reform tax credits to make them fairer and more affordable. On top of Child Benefit for every child, an out of work family with 5 children can currently claim over £14,000 a year in tax credits alone. The government believes that those in receipt of tax credits should face the same financial choices about having children as those supporting themselves solely through work. </p>\n\n<p>The Budget will therefore limit support provided to families through tax credits to 2 children, so that any subsequent children born after April 2017 will not be eligible for further support. An equivalent change will be made in Housing Benefit to ensure consistency between both benefits. This will also apply in Universal Credit to families who make a new claim from April 2017. </p>\n\n<p>In addition, those starting a family after April 2017 will no longer be eligible for the Family Element in tax credits. The equivalent in Universal Credit, known as the first child premium, will also not be available for new claims after April 2017. In Housing Benefit, the family premium will be withdrawn for new claims from April 2016, to ensure fairness between those who receive Housing Benefit and those who do not. </p>\n\n<p>Child Benefit will continue to be paid at the same level for all children. The existing entitlement of families who remain in receipt of tax credits and Universal Credit will be unaffected by the reforms to limit support to 2 children and the abolition of the family premium. This will mean that those who already have larger families and have made plans on the basis of the current system will not lose out. The disabled child premia in tax credits and UC will also continue to be paid to all children with a disability.</p>\n\n<p>These changes will see expenditure on tax credits return to 2007-08 levels in real terms. In 2016-17, 5 in 10 families with children will be supported through tax credits, down from 6 in 10 today and 9 out of 10 in 2010<sup id=\"fnref:59\"><a href=\"#fn:59\" class=\"footnote\">59</a></sup>. Chart 1.15 compares past and forecast expenditure on tax credits and predecessor benefits as a proportion of <abbr title=\"Gross Domestic Product\">GDP</abbr>, and illustrates the impact of these reforms.</p>\n\n<p>Taking the welfare changes together with the introduction of the NLW and record increases in the income tax personal allowance, this will mean that 8 out of 10 working households will be better off in 2017-18 by an average of £130. A couple over 25 working full time on the <abbr title=\"National Minimum Wage\">NMW</abbr> and who benefit from the NLW, with 2 children, will take home a higher net income by 2020-21 than they did in 2015-16.

Given the success of the household benefit cap in encouraging households to look for work, the government will lower the cap on the total amount of benefits an out of work family can receive, from £26,000 to £20,000, except in London where higher rents will be recognised through a £23,000 cap. Households subject to the cap still receive substantial support: a cap at £23,000 is equivalent to typical pre-tax earnings of around £29,000, and a cap at £20,000 is equivalent to typical pre-tax earnings of around £25,000. Those who find a job will continue to be exempt from the household benefit cap, creating a clear incentive to move into work. Exemptions will continue to apply for the most vulnerable disabled people.</p>\n\n<p>To help ensure Local Authorities are able to protect the most vulnerable housing benefit claimants, the government will provide £800 million of funding for Discretionary Housing Payments over the next 5 years.</p>\n\n<p>The government believes that those on higher incomes should not be subsidised through social rents. Therefore, social housing tenants with household incomes of £40,000 and above in London, and £30,000 and above in the rest of England, will be required to “Pay to Stay”, by paying a market or near market rent for their accommodation. This will ensure they pay a fair level of rent, or make way for those whose need is greater. Local Authorities will repay the rent subsidy that they recover from high income tenants to the Exchequer, contributing to deficit reduction. Housing Associations will be able to use the rent subsidy that they recover to reinvest in new housing. This could raise up to hundreds of millions of pounds in additional rental income for Housing Associations. The government will consult and set out the detail of this reform in due course. </p>\n\n<p>The government will review the use of lifetime tenancies in social housing to limit their use and ensure that households are offered tenancies that match their needs, and ensure the best use is made of the social housing stock.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, those who receive benefits to help to pay their mortgage interest are able to do so indefinitely with no need to pay anything back. This Budget takes action to convert the Support for Mortgage Interest scheme into a loan, so that homeowners repay the financial support they receive.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"employment-support\">Employment support</h4>\n\n<p>The government is committed to achieving full employment: it has already set out its ambition for the UK to have the highest employment rate in the <abbr title=\"A group of 7 major industrial nations (comprising: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, UK and US)\">G7</abbr> and will introduce a statutory duty on the government to report progress against this ambition. Achieving full employment means backing business, reforming welfare and rewarding work. But it also means ensuring that all groups in society are given the support they need to find and keep a job.</p>\n\n<p>To help young people move into and get on in work, the Budget will introduce a new Youth Obligation for 18 to 21 year olds on Universal Credit. From April 2017, young people will participate in an intensive regime of support from day 1 of their benefit claim, and after 6 months they will be expected to apply for an apprenticeship or traineeship, gain work-based skills, or go on a mandatory work placement to give them the skills they need to move into sustainable employment.</p>\n\n<p>To prevent young people slipping straight into a life on benefits, from April 2017 the Budget will also remove the automatic entitlement to housing support for new claims in Universal Credit from 18-21 year olds who are out of work. This will ensure young people in the benefits system face the same choices as young people who work and who may not be able to afford to leave home. There will be exemptions, including for vulnerable young people, those who may not be able to return home to live with their parents, and those who have been in work for 6 months prior to making a claim, who will continue to be able to receive housing support for up to 6 months while they look for work. </p>\n\n<p>Increasing employment levels amongst people with disabilities and health conditions are a key part of the government’s aim to achieve full employment. The current system creates a financial incentive to claim sickness benefits over jobseeker’s allowance. From April 2017, new claimants of Employment and Support Allowance (ESA) who are placed in the Work-Related Activity Group will therefore receive the same rate as those claiming Jobseeker’s Allowance, alongside additional support to help them take steps back to work. This will ensure the right incentives and support are in place for those closer to the labour market to help them make this transition when they are ready, while maintaining the extra financial support ESA provides for those in the ESA Support Group who are furthest from work. Existing ESA claimants will be unaffected. </p>\n\n<p>The government will also consider where employers and insurers should play a greater role in providing support for those who suffer from industrial injuries in the workplace. The government will report at the Spending Review.</p>\n\n<p>While progress has been made in women’s employment, inequalities remain – the female employment rate is around 10 percentage points lower than for men. Much of this relates to childcare: according to the 2012-13 Department for Education childcare and early years survey of parents, over half (54%) of non-working mothers agreed that they would like to go out to work if they could arrange good quality childcare that was convenient, reliable and affordable. </p>\n\n<p>This Budget confirms that, from September 2017, the free childcare entitlement will be doubled from 15 hours to 30 hours a week for working parents of 3 and 4 year olds. This will support those who choose to go out to work. The government will implement this extension of free hours early in some local areas from September 2016. This free childcare is worth around £5,000 a year per child<sup id=\"fnref:60\"><a href=\"#fn:60\" class=\"footnote\">60</a></sup>. To support delivery, the government has committed to raise the average hourly rate providers receive and is undertaking a review of childcare costs in order to set a rate that is fair for providers and delivers value for money for the taxpayer.</p>\n\n<p>The government also reaffirms its commitment to deliver Tax-Free Childcare to support parents in the decision to go out to work, or work more, and provide security for their families. As announced on 1 July, the government welcomes the Supreme Court’s judgment that its proposals for delivering the scheme are clearly lawful and Tax-Free Childcare will now be introduced from early 2017.</p>\n\n<p>In the meantime, the government is taking action to support parents with childcare costs by holding open the existing Employer Supported Childcare scheme to new entrants until Tax-Free Childcare is launched. Parents who wish to remain in Employer Supported Childcare once Tax-Free Childcare is launched will be able to, while their current employer continues to offer the voucher scheme. The new scheme will support up to 1.8 million working families by providing up to £2,000 of childcare support per year per child. </p>\n\n<p>In the context of the extensive childcare support offered to parents of 3 and 4 year olds, the government will also change the conditions for parents claiming out of work benefits. Parents with a youngest child aged 3 or older (including lone parents) who are able to work will be expected to look for work if they are claiming Universal Credit. These parents will receive support from Jobcentre Plus. This is a further step in a process of reform which has helped lift the proportion of lone parent families in work to its highest level since 1996.</p>\n\n<p>The government will also provide £30 million to further speed up the adoption process while paving the way for the introduction of regional adoption agencies.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"eliminating-the-deficit-in-a-fair-way\">\n<span class=\"number\">3.5 </span>Eliminating the deficit in a fair way</h3>\n\n<p>The government is committed to eliminating the deficit in a fair way, while supporting working people through the tax system and higher wages. The cornerstone of this commitment is to introduce legislation for a “tax lock” to rule out increases in the main rates of income tax, <abbr title=\"Value Added Tax\">VAT</abbr> and National Insurance for the duration of this Parliament, providing certainty to working people.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, the government will continue to target those who evade or avoid paying taxes to ensure that all businesses and individuals make a fair contribution towards reducing the deficit. This will build on the government’s crackdown on tax avoidance, aggressive tax planning and evasion over the last Parliament, which achieved £7 billion of annual savings. The government has also identified a number of imbalances in the tax system where support disproportionately benefits certain groups or types of business structure, and this Budget addresses those imbalances.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"ensuring-individuals-and-businesses-pay-what-they-owe\">\n<span class=\"number\">3.6 </span>Ensuring individuals and businesses pay what they owe</h3>\n\n<p>The majority of individuals and businesses pay their fair share of tax. However, there are some who fail to pay what they owe due to error or a failure to comply with their obligations as a taxpayer. There are also a small group who deliberately try to evade paying the tax they should. </p>\n\n<p>This Budget announces significant additional investment in <abbr title=\"HM Revenue and Customs\">HMRC</abbr>’s work on non‑compliance and tax evasion covering a range of areas. The government will invest £800 million over this Parliament.</p>\n\n<p>This includes tripling the number of criminal investigations that <abbr title=\"HM Revenue and Customs\">HMRC</abbr> can undertake into serious and complex tax crime, focusing particularly on wealthy individuals and corporates, with the aim of increasing prosecutions in this area to 100 a year by the end of the Parliament. </p>\n\n<p>As well as announcing additional resource for the measures announced today on evasion and non-compliance, the government is committed to providing <abbr title=\"HM Revenue and Customs\">HMRC</abbr> with the funding it needs to maintain its current level of compliance performance, while making efficiencies. <abbr title=\"HM Revenue and Customs\">HMRC</abbr>’s compliance yield targets will increase to reflect the impact of the Budget measures. </p>\n\n<h4 id=\"businesses\">Businesses</h4>\n\n<p>To improve tax compliance among large businesses, the government will introduce legislation to improve transparency of tax strategies and give <abbr title=\"HM Revenue and Customs\">HMRC</abbr> new powers to tackle those businesses who persistently engage in aggressive tax planning. </p>\n\n<p>To improve tax compliance among small businesses, the government will legislate to give <abbr title=\"HM Revenue and Customs\">HMRC</abbr> the power to acquire data from online business intermediaries and electronic payment providers to help identify businesses that are trading but not declaring or paying tax. <abbr title=\"HM Revenue and Customs\">HMRC</abbr> will consult on these proposals in July 2015. </p>\n\n<p>From 8 July 2015, the government will change the tax rules to stop the use of losses against tax that should be paid through the Controlled Foreign Companies (CFC) rules. This will improve the effectiveness of the UK CFC regime in countering aggressive tax planning by multinational companies while maintaining the overall competitiveness of the UK Corporation Tax regime.</p>\n\n<p>The government will stop investment fund managers from using tax loopholes to avoid paying the correct amount of capital gains tax (<abbr title=\"Capital gains tax\">CGT</abbr>) on the profits of the fund payable to them (known as carried interest). This measure will have immediate effect by requiring taxpayers who receive carried interest to pay the full 28% <abbr title=\"Capital gains tax\">CGT</abbr> charge on their award. Asset managers will no longer be able to use tax planning to reduce the value of the gain. The government continues to support the asset management industry in the UK, and considers that carried interest should be subject to <abbr title=\"Capital gains tax\">CGT</abbr>, as it reflects the underlying long term performance of a fund’s investments.</p>\n\n<p>The government will also launch a consultation on the circumstances in which fund managers’ performance-related returns are to benefit from <abbr title=\"Capital gains tax\">CGT</abbr> treatment. The consultation will set out and clarify the circumstances in which performance fees arising to fund managers from management activities will be capital in nature.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"employment-taxes\">Employment taxes</h4>\n\n<p>Employment taxes contribute over 40% of <abbr title=\"HM Revenue and Customs\">HMRC</abbr> receipts. However, there are many different mechanisms that employers and individuals use to reduce taxes paid on earnings. This is not fair. Two individuals doing the same job, in the same way, can end up paying very different levels of tax. The government wants to take steps to address this.</p>\n\n<p>The government recognises that many individuals choose to work through their own limited company. However, where people would have been employees if they were providing their services directly, anti-avoidance legislation commonly known as IR35 introduced in 2000 requires that they pay broadly the same tax and National Insurance as other employees. As highlighted by reports from the Office of Tax Simplification and the House of Lords, it is clear that IR35 is not effective enough. Non-compliance in this area is estimated to cost over £400 million a year. </p>\n\n<p>The government has asked <abbr title=\"HM Revenue and Customs\">HMRC</abbr> to start a dialogue with business on how to improve the effectiveness of existing IR35 legislation. The government wants to find a solution that protects the Exchequer and improves fairness in the system. </p>\n\n<h4 id=\"wealthy-individuals\">Wealthy individuals</h4>\n\n<p>To improve tax compliance among wealthy individuals, the government will consult on enhancing the information reported to <abbr title=\"HM Revenue and Customs\">HMRC</abbr> by wealthy individuals and trustees, and is extending <abbr title=\"HM Revenue and Customs\">HMRC</abbr>’s use of dedicated Customer Relationship Managers to individuals with net wealth between £10 million and £20 million. Together, these proposals will help ensure <abbr title=\"HM Revenue and Customs\">HMRC</abbr> has an in-depth understanding of wealthy individuals’ tax affairs and the risks they present. </p>\n\n<h4 id=\"serial-offenders\">Serial offenders</h4>\n\n<p>For those individuals who continue to avoid paying the correct level of tax, the government will strengthen the penalty for doing so, which will also act as a wider deterrent from such activities. The government will consult on the technical details of introducing tougher measures for those who persistently enter into tax avoidance schemes that fail, including a surcharge on those whose latest tax return is inaccurate due to use of a failed scheme and publishing the names of such avoiders. Following the announcement at Budget 2015, the government will also consult on the detail of a new General Anti-Abuse Rule (<abbr title=\"General Anti-Abuse Rule\">GAAR</abbr>) penalty. The <abbr title=\"General Anti-Abuse Rule\">GAAR</abbr> penalty will be proportional to the amount of tax recovered by the <abbr title=\"General Anti-Abuse Rule\">GAAR</abbr>.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"addressing-imbalances-in-the-tax-system\">\n<span class=\"number\">3.7 </span>Addressing imbalances in the tax system</h3>\n\n<p>The government has identified a number of areas of the tax system where imbalances have developed over time and where certain reliefs are disproportionately benefiting certain groups of individuals. This Budget seeks to make the tax system fairer and better at supporting a productive economy.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"individuals\">\n<span class=\"number\">3.8 </span>Individuals</h3>\n\n<h4 id=\"dividends\">Dividends</h4>\n\n<p>The current system of tax credits on dividends was designed over 40 years ago when corporation tax was more than 50% and the total tax bill on dividends for some was more than 80%. Since then, tax rates including corporation tax have fallen, leaving the Dividend Tax Credit as an arcane and complex feature of the tax system.</p>\n\n<p>Alongside further cuts to corporation tax rates for all businesses, the government will reform and simplify the system of dividend taxation, while maintaining the extensive tax reliefs for investments held in ISAs and pensions. From April 2016 the government will remove the Dividend Tax Credit and replace it with a new tax-free Dividend Allowance of £5,000 a year for all taxpayers. This will ensure that ordinary investors with smaller portfolios and modest dividend income will see no change in their tax liability – and some will pay less tax.</p>\n\n<p>Combined with the increases the government has made to the personal allowance and the introduction of the Personal Savings Allowance, from April 2016 individuals will be able to receive up to £17,000 of income per annum tax-free, and separately invest up to £15,240 per annum through an <abbr title=\"Individual savings account\">ISA</abbr> tax-free.</p>\n\n<p>The government will set the dividend tax rates at 7.5% for basic rate taxpayers, 32.5% for higher rate taxpayers and 38.1% for additional rate taxpayers. While these rates remain below the main rates of income tax, those who receive significant dividend income – for example due to very large shareholdings (typically more than £140,000) or as a result of receiving significant dividends through a closed company – will pay more.</p>\n\n<p>These changes will also start to reduce the incentive to incorporate and remunerate through dividends rather than through wages to reduce tax liabilities. This will reduce the cost to the Exchequer of future tax motivated incorporation (TMI) by £500 million a year from 2019-20. The tax system will continue to encourage entrepreneurship and investment, including through lower rates of Corporation Tax.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"landlords\">Landlords</h4>\n\n<p>The current tax system supports landlords over and above ordinary homeowners. Landlords can deduct costs they incur when calculating the tax they pay on their rental income. A large portion of those costs are interest payments on the mortgage. Mortgage Interest Relief was withdrawn from homeowners 15 years ago. However, landlords still receive the relief. </p>\n\n<p>The ability to deduct these costs puts investing in a rental property at an advantage. Tax relief for finance costs is particularly beneficial for wealthier landlords with larger incomes, as every £1 of finance cost they incur allows them to pay 40p or 45p less tax. The Bank of England has also noted in its recent Financial Stability Report that the rapid growth of buy to let mortgages could pose a risk to the UK’s financial stability<sup id=\"fnref:61\"><a href=\"#fn:61\" class=\"footnote\">61</a></sup>.</p>\n\n<p>The government will restrict the relief on finance costs that landlords of residential property can get to the basic rate of income tax. The restriction will be phased in over 4 years, starting from April 2017. This will reduce the distorting effect the tax treatment of property has on investment and mean individual landlords are not treated differently based on the rate of income tax that they pay. It will also shift the balance between landlords and homeowners. </p>\n\n<p>The government will also reform how landlords of residential property can account for the costs they incur in improving and maintaining rental property. Currently, landlords of furnished properties can deduct 10% of their rent from their profit to account for wear and tear, irrespective of their expenditure. This means landlords can reduce their tax liability even when they have not improved the property. From April 2016, the government will replace this allowance with a new system that enables all landlords of residential property to only deduct costs they actually incur.</p>\n\n<p>The government will increase the Rent-a-Room relief from £4,250 to £7,500 a year from April 2016. The value of this relief has been frozen since 1997, so this increase will allow individuals who rent a room in their main residence to do so tax free on income up to £7,500 to reflect increases in rent.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"non-domiciled-individuals\">Non-domiciled individuals</h4>\n\n<p>Within a controlled immigration system, the government wants the UK to be a destination that will attract talented people to work and to do business. Having a tax system that is internationally competitive brings in talent and investment which contributes to the growth of the economy. The UK’s rules for those who are not domiciled here are important in attracting people to live and to work here. The government remains committed to that aim. However, the government also wants the system to be fair. It believes that those who choose to live in the UK for a long time should pay taxes here like everybody else.</p>\n\n<p>From April 2017, anybody who has been resident in the UK for more than 15 of the past 20 tax years will be deemed UK-domiciled for tax purposes. Furthermore, it will no longer be possible for somebody who is born in the UK to parents who are UK domiciled to claim non-domicile status if they leave but then return and take up residency in the UK. These changes will bring an end to the permanent non-domicile status. They create a fairer system while protecting the ability of the UK to continue to attract individuals to come to the UK to work and invest. </p>\n\n<p>From April 2017 the government will also introduce new rules so that everybody who owns residential property in the UK and would otherwise pay inheritance tax on that property cannot avoid paying it by holding it in an offshore structure. These changes will limit abuses of the rules by people with non-domicile status who use complicated structures to make their UK homes look like offshore assets. </p>\n\n<h4 id=\"national-insurance-contributions\">National Insurance contributions</h4>\n\n<p>Salary sacrifice arrangements can allow some employees and employers to reduce the income tax and National Insurance that they pay on remuneration. They are becoming increasingly popular and the cost to the taxpayer is rising. The government will actively monitor the growth of these schemes and their effect on tax receipts.</p>\n\n<p>To ensure that the <abbr title=\"National Insurance contributions\">NICs</abbr> Employment Allowance is focussed on businesses and charities that support employment, from April 2016, companies where the director is the sole employee will no longer be able to claim the Employment Allowance.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"businesses-1\">\n<span class=\"number\">3.9 </span>Businesses</h3>\n\n<p>The government wants a more simple tax system that enables UK businesses to compete, and this Budget sets out a number of steps to achieving this. However, a tax system that is fair for all taxpayers means ensuring a fair contribution from businesses. </p>\n\n<h4 id=\"banking-tax-reform\">Banking tax reform</h4>\n\n<p>While the government considers that banks and building societies should make an additional contribution to reflect their unique risks, it recognises the need to balance this with considerations around UK competitiveness and banks’ ability to support the broader economy.</p>\n\n<p>This Budget therefore sets out a long-term roadmap for the taxation of banks, designed to maintain this balance and take account of the very significant improvements in banking sector regulation and underlying profitability since the bank levy was first introduced. This involves three steps:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the introduction of a new tax on banking sector profit from 1 January 2016, set at a permanent rate of 8%</li>\n  <li>a phased reduction of the bank levy rate, from the existing rate of 0.21% to 0.18% from January 2016, 0.17% from January 2017, 0.16% from January 2018, 0.15% from January 2019, 0.14% from January 2020 and 0.10% from January 2021</li>\n  <li>a change in the bank levy’s scope from 1 January 2021, meaning that UK headquartered banks are levied on their UK balance sheet liabilities</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>This plan is forecast to increase banks’ additional contribution by around £2 billion across the forecast period, helping to ensure banks make a fair contribution. </p>\n\n<p>However, it also sets a path towards a more competitive and sustainable model for raising revenue from the banking sector over the longer-term, which is a 26% rate of tax on profit – the lowest among <abbr title=\"A group of 7 major industrial nations (comprising: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, UK and US)\">G7</abbr> nations – and a 0.1% levy on UK balance sheet liabilities. </p>\n\n<p>This means that banks’ contributions will be increasingly aligned with profit and capital accumulation, reducing the risk of tax constraining lending or influencing banks’ decisions on the location of internationally mobile activities. It also means that banks’ contributions will be increasingly linked to activities within the UK, helping to reduce the impact of tax on the competitiveness of UK banks’ overseas operations and helping to reflect the ongoing impact of regulatory reform and resolution planning in reducing the risk of these operations to the UK economy. </p>\n\n<p>Finally, by allowing tax receipts to respond naturally to changes in banks’ balance sheets and profitability, these changes will introduce stability into the banking tax regime and ensure that banks can incorporate tax into their business plans with greater certainty. This is reinforced by the government’s decision to legislate the bank levy rate, out to and including 2020-21, in the upcoming Finance Bill. </p>\n\n<p>As part of this banking tax roadmap, this Budget also announces that relief will be provided against the UK bank levy for payments made to the Eurozone Resolution Fund, consistent with the government’s general policy on avoiding double imposition. Affected banks will be able to claim relief from 1 January 2016. </p>\n\n<p>Companies are currently entitled to deduct the costs of compensation payments in calculating their profits liable for Corporation Tax. As announced at Budget 2015, the government is legislating to make compensation payments paid by banks in relation to widespread misconduct in the sector non-deductible for Corporation Tax purposes, effective from 8 July 2015. This is forecast to increase bank’s Corporation Tax payments by around £1 billion over the next 6 years. </p>\n\n<h4 id=\"insurance\">Insurance</h4>\n\n<p>The government remains committed to ensuring customers can purchase insurance at a fair price. The cost of home contents insurance has fallen by 8% since last year, and the cost of comprehensive private motor insurance has fallen by 10% in the last 3 years. The government will reform the regulation of the claims management sector to help to drive out further unnecessary costs from insurance premiums. This Budget announces a fundamental review of the regulation of claims management companies (CMCs), led by the Chairman of the Chartered Trading Standard Institute Board Carol Brady, which will report to HM Treasury and the Ministry of Justice in early 2016. In addition, there is also a case for reform of the fees that CMCs charge consumers, particularly in those instances where consumer complaints fall within the remit of the Financial Ombudsman Service. Therefore, the government will bring forward proposals for the introduction of a cap on the charges that CMCs can apply to their customers, and will consult on how this will work in practice. </p>\n\n<p>This builds on the success of previous measures including the ban on referral fees and action to address fraudulent whiplash claims. The Insurance Fraud Taskforce will report by the end of 2015 on what can be done to reduce the impact of fraud on insurance premiums. To further assist car owners, the government will extend the deadline for new cars and motorcycles to have a first MOT test from 3 years to 4, saving motorists more than £100 million per year, subject to public consultation and cost-benefit evaluation. If people compare the different options available for their insurance they can generally get a much better deal, but many people simply renew with their existing insurer without checking the price they could get elsewhere. The Financial Conduct Authority (<abbr title=\"Financial Conduct Authority\">FCA</abbr>) will review what more can be done to ensure that people are encouraged to shop around when they renew their insurance.</p>\n\n<p>From 1 November, the standard rate of Insurance Premium Tax will be increased from 6% to 9.5%. The Insurance Premium Tax standard rate will remain lower than that of many other <abbr title=\"European Union\">EU</abbr> Member States. It will, for example, continue to be much lower than the 19% tax rate that applies in Germany. Seperately, the government will also introduce <abbr title=\"Value Added Tax\">VAT</abbr> provisions to level the playing field for insurers. This will deter insurers from routing costs via offshore associates and ensure UK <abbr title=\"Value Added Tax\">VAT</abbr> is accounted for an all repair services on UK insurance contracts.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"corporation-tax\">Corporation tax</h4>\n\n<p>The government will reform the corporation tax rules to stop companies claiming an annual deduction from their taxable profits for the acquisition cost of assets linked to the business’ reputation and customer relationships. This is consistent with the rules in other major economies. The government continues to support company growth and expansion, and believes this will remove a distortion in the market which is artificially altering the way companies choose to expand. This change has immediate effect and will only impact future purchases of assets.</p>\n\n<p>Currently, large companies in the UK pay tax in instalments, but they do not start paying tax until the seventh month of their accounting period. This means that large UK companies pay tax later than in most other <abbr title=\"A group of 7 major industrial nations (comprising: Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, UK and US)\">G7</abbr> countries, and later than most individuals. This lag creates a cost to the Exchequer. The government will bring forward payment dates for the largest companies in the UK – those with profits in excess of £20 million – so payments are made closer to the point when a company earns a profit. From April 2017 these companies will be required to make corporation tax payments in the third, sixth, ninth and twelfth months of their accounting period.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"tobacco-and-alcohol\">Tobacco and alcohol</h4>\n\n<p>The consultation launched at Autumn Statement 2014 on introducing a tobacco levy has now ended. Analysis of the responses shows that the impact of a tobacco levy on the tobacco market would be similar to a duty rise, with tobacco manufacturers and importers passing the levy onto consumer prices. </p>\n\n<p><abbr title=\"HM Revenue and Customs\">HMRC</abbr> analysis shows that a levy of £150 million would only raise £25 million after behavioural effects. The methodology used to calculate the impact of a levy on the public finances has been verified by Ulrike Hotopp, the Chief Economist at the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. As tobacco duties have already increased this year and will continue to increase by more than inflation each year in this Parliament, the government has decided not to introduce a levy on tobacco manufacturers and importers. The consultation responses will be published shortly.</p>\n\n<p>This Budget also announces additional resource for <abbr title=\"HM Revenue and Customs\">HMRC</abbr> to tackle the organised crime gangs behind the illicit tobacco and alcohol markets. </p>\n\n<p>The government is also committed to supporting small cider makers given their important role in rural communities. The government will retain the current duty exemption until and unless a replacement scheme is established.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"supporting-savers\">\n<span class=\"number\">3.10 </span>Supporting Savers</h3>\n\n<p>The government is committed to supporting savers at all stages of their lives to help them secure a better financial future for themselves and their family. Over the last Parliament, the government took significant action to give people greater freedom and control over their pensions, and to reduce taxes for savers. This Budget continues this support by ensuring that people can pass on assets built up over their lifetime to their family without worrying about inheritance tax, and that people have access to high quality advice to help make financial decisions.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"inheritance-tax\">Inheritance tax</h4>\n\n<p>The government understands that people aspire to build up assets with the aim of passing them on to the next generation in their family, and believes that working families should be able to pass on those assets to their children and grandchildren without needing to worry about inheritance tax. Only the very wealthiest in our society should be asked to pay tax on the assets built up over their lifetime. </p>\n\n<p>However, rising house prices are contributing to nearly double the number of estates facing an inheritance tax bill by 2020-21. 63,000 estates are forecast to have a tax liability in 2020-21, which is more than at any time since inheritance tax was introduced. The government’s reforms will reduce the number of estates forecast to have a tax liability in 2020-21 to 37,000, around the same levels as in 2014-15. </p>\n\n<p>The government will achieve this by taking the family home out of inheritance tax for all but the wealthiest with a new transferable nil-rate band, introduced from April 2017. This will apply when a main residence is passed on death to direct descendants, such as a child or grandchild. The allowance will be up to £100,000 in 2017-18, up to £125,000 in 2018-19, up to £150,000 in 2019-20, and up to £175,000 in 2020-21. This is in addition to the inheritance tax nil-rate band, which is set at £325,000 for the estates of individuals. This creates an effective £500,000 inheritance tax threshold for estates in 2020-21. As with the current nil-rate band, any unused main residence nil-rate band will be transferred to a surviving spouse or civil partner and means the effective inheritance tax threshold will rise to £1 million in 2020-21.</p>\n\n<p>The new main residence nil rate band will also be available when a person downsizes or ceases to own a home on or after 8 July 2015 and assets of an equivalent value, up to £175,000 in 2020-21, are passed on death to direct descendants. For example, an individual might choose to downsize from a home worth £200,000 to a home worth £100,000. They could still benefit from the maximum allowance of £175,000 in 2020-21 if they leave the home and £75,000 of other assets to direct descendants. They will only be liable to inheritance tax if the total estate exceeds £500,000. The new thresholds are illustrated in chart 1.17.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"chart-117-effective-inheritance-tax-thresholds-in-2020-21\">Chart 1.17: Effective Inheritance Tax thresholds in 2020-21</h4>\n\n<figure class=\"image embedded\">\n  <div class=\"img\"><img alt=\"Chart 1.17\" src=\"https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/41324/50325-Chart-1.17.jpg\"></div>\n</figure>\n\n<p>To ensure that the wealthiest estates continue to make a greater contribution to inheritance tax receipts, there will be a tapered withdrawal of the main residence nil‑rate band for estates with a net value of more than £2 million. The existing nil‑rate band will also remain at £325,000 from 2018-19 until the end of 2020-2021. This ensures the effective inheritance tax threshold will be up to £1 million by the end of the Parliament. The number of estates making a contribution to inheritance tax or its predecessor will continue to be higher at the end of the decade than in any year between its introduction and 2014-15. The chart below illustrates the number of estates liable for inheritance tax and cash receipts. </p>\n\n<h4 id=\"chart-118-outturn-and-forecast-for-inheritance-tax-iht-receipts-and-number-of-estates-with-a-liability-on-death-between-1986-87-and-2020-21\">Chart 1.18: Outturn and forecast for Inheritance Tax (<abbr title=\"Inheritance Tax\">IHT</abbr>) receipts and number of estates with a liability on death between 1986-87 and 2020-21</h4>\n\n<figure class=\"image embedded\">\n  <div class=\"img\"><img alt=\"Chart 1.18\" src=\"https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/41325/50325-Chart-1.18.jpg\"></div>\n</figure>\n\n<h4 id=\"pensions-tax\">Pensions tax</h4>\n\n<p>To pay for the reforms to inheritance tax and to control the cost of pensions tax relief in the short term the government needs to make sure that the support provided to pension savers is affordable and targeted where it is needed most. </p>\n\n<p>Therefore, from April 2016 the government will introduce a taper to the Annual Allowance for those with adjusted annual incomes, including their own and employer’s pension contributions, over £150,000<sup id=\"fnref:62\"><a href=\"#fn:62\" class=\"footnote\">62</a></sup>. For every £2 of adjusted income over £150,000, an individual’s Annual Allowance, the limit on the amount of tax relieved pension saving that can be made by an individual or their employer each year, will be reduced by £1, down to a minimum of £10,000. </p>\n\n<p>To ensure this measure is focussed on the higher and additional rate tax payers who currently gain the most benefit from pensions tax relief, those with income, excluding pension contributions, below a £110,000 threshold will not be subject to a Tapered Annual Allowance. Only 1% of taxpayers exceed this threshold and save into pensions, and even fewer will actually be affected by this measure.</p>\n\n<p>The government also wants to make sure that the right incentives are in place to encourage saving into pensions in the longer term. The government is therefore consulting on whether there is a case for reforming pensions tax relief to strengthen incentives to save, offering savers greater simplicity and transparency, or whether it would be best to keep the current system. The government is interested in views on the various options that have been suggested for how the system could be reformed. These range from a fundamental reform of the system (for example moving to a system which is “Taxed-Exempt-Exempt” like ISAs and providing a government top-up on pension contributions) to less radical changes (such as retaining the current system and altering the lifetime and annual allowances), as well as options in between.</p>\n\n<p>Any reform to pensions tax relief would build on the reforms to the pension and savings tax systems announced in the last Parliament, which have already given individuals greater freedom with their money and flexibility over how they hold their savings.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"pension-and-savings-flexibilities\">Pension and savings flexibilities</h4>\n\n<p>Over 85,000 people have taken advantage of the new flexibilities for accessing pensions that were introduced in April 2015. The government believes it is important that all consumers can access free, high quality guidance on their choices. Following the successful launch of Pension Wise in April 2015, the government is extending access to this free and impartial guidance service to those aged 50 and above, and is launching a comprehensive nationwide marketing campaign to further raise awareness of the service.</p>\n\n<p>The government also wants to ensure that people can access the new flexibilities easily, and at reasonable cost. The government will consult before the summer on options aimed at making the process for transferring pensions from one scheme to another quicker and smoother, including in relation to any excessive early exit penalties. If there is evidence of such penalties, the government will consider imposing a legislative cap on these charges for those aged 55 or over.</p>\n\n<p>The government wants existing annuity holders to have the freedom to sell their annuity income. The government will set out plans for a secondary annuities market in the autumn, and agrees with respondents to the recent consultation that implementation should be delayed until 2017 to ensure there is an in-depth package to support consumers in making their decision. </p>\n\n<p>The government is committed to supporting savers at every stage of their life. From April 2016 the government will deliver a major reduction in the level of tax on savings with the introduction of the Personal Savings Allowance, which will exempt the first £1,000 of savings income from tax for basic rate taxpayers and the first £500 for higher rate taxpayers, and as detailed above, this Budget announces the creation of a new £5,000 dividend allowance. </p>\n\n<h4 id=\"help-to-buy-isa\">Help to Buy: <abbr title=\"Individual savings account\">ISA</abbr>\n</h4>\n\n<p>To help as many people as possible realise their aspirations of home ownership, the Help to Buy: <abbr title=\"Individual savings account\">ISA</abbr> was announced at Budget 2015. This supports people saving up for their first home by providing them with a maximum government bonus of £3,000 on £12,000 of savings. The government is today announcing that Help to Buy: ISAs will be available for first time buyers to start saving into from 1 December 2015. First time buyers will be able to deposit £200 per month into their Help to Buy: <abbr title=\"Individual savings account\">ISA</abbr> at participating banks and building societies. First time buyers will be able to open their Help to Buy: <abbr title=\"Individual savings account\">ISA</abbr> accounts with an additional  one off deposit of £1000 so that they can start saving now.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"equitable-life-payment-scheme\">Equitable Life Payment Scheme</h4>\n\n<p>The Equitable Life Payment Scheme, which began making payments in 2011, has paid out over £1 billion to around 87% of eligible policyholders. The government is announcing today that the Equitable Life Payment Scheme will close to new claims on 31 December 2015. As part of this, the government will undertake a further effort to trace remaining policy holders due £50 or more. With Profits Annuitants will continue to receive annual payments under the Scheme for their lifetimes. This Budget also announces that eligible policyholders in receipt of Pension Credit will see their lump sum payment doubled, with payments made in early 2016.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"backing-business-and-improving-productivity-1\">\n<span class=\"number\">4. </span>Backing business and improving productivity</h2>\n\n<p>Productivity is the most important determinant of living standards.

Boosting productivity presents a once in a generation opportunity to find an extra gear for the British economy, underpinning the UK’s growth and living standards for years to come. In every member country of the <abbr title=\"Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development\">OECD</abbr> where average wages are above UK levels, productivity is also higher<sup id=\"fnref:65\"><a href=\"#fn:65\" class=\"footnote\">65</a></sup>.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"chart-119-productivity-and-living-standards\">Chart 1.19: Productivity and living standards</h4>\n\n<figure class=\"image embedded\">\n  <div class=\"img\"><img alt=\"Chart 1.19\" src=\"https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/41326/50325-Chart-1.19.jpg\"></div>\n</figure>\n\n<p>If the UK matched the productivity of the US, <abbr title=\"Gross Domestic Product\">GDP</abbr> would be 31% higher – equating to an extra £21,000 for each household<sup id=\"fnref:66\"><a href=\"#fn:66\" class=\"footnote\">66</a></sup>.

Full details will be set out in the productivity plan. </p>\n\n<p>Productivity means creating a competitive environment in which businesses operate. This in turn allows businesses to create jobs and raise wages. </p>\n\n<p>The government wants to go further to support business, enterprise and investment. That is why this Budget will:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>cut the UK’s corporation tax rate to the lowest in the <abbr title=\"A group of 20 finance ministers and central bank governors representing 19 countries plus the European Union\">G20</abbr>\n</li>\n  <li>set the Annual Investment Allowance at its highest ever permanent level</li>\n  <li>create a Roads Fund through reforming vehicle excise duty for new cars, restoring it to its pre-2013 value</li>\n  <li>fund new apprenticeships through a levy on large employers</li>\n  <li>put higher education funding onto a more sustainable footing, with maintenance loans replacing grants saving £2.5 billion by 2020-21</li>\n  <li>build a Northern Powerhouse and ensure the productive potential of all parts of the UK is realised</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"backing-business\">\n<span class=\"number\">4.1 </span>Backing business</h3>\n\n<p>In the last Parliament the government backed business by cutting corporation tax from 28% to 20%. The Employment Allowance reduced the cost of employer National Insurance contributions (<abbr title=\"National Insurance contributions\">NICs</abbr>) for over 1 million employers, and over £4 billion of support was announced to business rates payers, particularly small businesses and retailers<sup id=\"fnref:67\"><a href=\"#fn:67\" class=\"footnote\">67</a></sup>. Businesses have taken the opportunity to create more jobs. Since 2010, more than 5 jobs have been created in the private sector for every job lost in the public sector<sup id=\"fnref:68\"><a href=\"#fn:68\" class=\"footnote\">68</a></sup>.

In this Parliament, the government will go further. The corporation tax rate will be cut to 19% in 2017 and 18% in 2020. These new cuts will save small and large businesses a further £6.6 billion by 2021, and will benefit 1.1 million businesses<sup id=\"fnref:71\"><a href=\"#fn:71\" class=\"footnote\">71</a></sup>. They will give the UK the lowest rate of corporation tax in the <abbr title=\"A group of 20 finance ministers and central bank governors representing 19 countries plus the European Union\">G20</abbr>, making the country even more attractive to inward investors.<sup id=\"fnref:72\"><a href=\"#fn:72\" class=\"footnote\">72</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>In 2013, the government published analysis modelling the economic impact of the corporation tax cuts delivered during the last Parliament<sup id=\"fnref:73\"><a href=\"#fn:73\" class=\"footnote\">73</a></sup>. This analysis has been updated to reflect the additional benefit of the rate cuts announced today<sup id=\"fnref:74\"><a href=\"#fn:74\" class=\"footnote\">74</a></sup>. It suggests that cutting corporation tax from 20% to 18% could increase <abbr title=\"Gross Domestic Product\">GDP</abbr> in the long run by between 0.1% and 0.2% (£1.8 to £3.6 billion in today’s prices) and that overall the cuts since 2010 could increase <abbr title=\"Gross Domestic Product\">GDP</abbr> by between 0.6% and 1% (£10.9 to £18.1 billion) in the long run. These numbers exclude the positive impact the cuts will have on inward investment.

To support businesses, particularly smaller ones, the government will raise the <abbr title=\"National Insurance contributions\">NICs</abbr> Employment Allowance from £2,000 to £3,000 a year from April 2016. As a result, up to 90,000 employers will be taken out of paying <abbr title=\"National Insurance contributions\">NICs</abbr>. This increased allowance means that firms employing up to 4 workers full time on the new NLW next year will not see their contributions increased.</p>\n\n<p>The government will further support investment by small- and medium-sized firms by increasing the permanent level of the Annual Investment Allowance (AIA) to £200,000 for all qualifying investment in plant and machinery made on or after 1 January 2016, its highest ever permanent level. The government commits to maintaining the AIA at this level for the rest of this Parliament, providing a cash flow benefit to companies who invest. Around 75% of the businesses who benefit are located outside of London and the South East, and the sectors with most companies benefitting will be manufacturing, wholesale and retail, and agriculture<sup id=\"fnref:75\"><a href=\"#fn:75\" class=\"footnote\">75</a></sup>.</p>\n\n<p>This Budget also announces that the government will make amendments to the tax-advantaged venture capital schemes to ensure that the UK continues to offer significant and well-targeted support for investment into small and growing companies, with a particular focus on innovative firms. </p>\n\n<p>The government recognises that businesses need certainty to enable them to plan and make long-term investments. To deliver this, the government will publish a business tax roadmap by April 2016, setting out plans for business taxes over the rest of the Parliament. The government is also running a wide-ranging review of business rates. This will be fiscally neutral and will be completed by the end of 2015. In addition, the government has today published progress updates on action it is taking to improve the administration of business rates, including the appeals system, and on tackling business rates avoidance.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"addressing-complexity-in-the-tax-system\">Addressing complexity in the tax system</h4>\n\n<p>The government aims to have a tax system that is simple to understand and easy to comply with. The government will establish the Office of Tax Simplification (<abbr title=\"Office of Tax Simplification\">OTS</abbr>) on a permanent basis with an expanded role and capacity. The new, expanded <abbr title=\"Office of Tax Simplification\">OTS</abbr> will be put on a statutory footing in Finance Bill 2016, and will advise the government on how to deliver a simpler tax system, providing independent advice on options for addressing existing complexity in the tax system. The terms of reference for the next <abbr title=\"Office of Tax Simplification\">OTS</abbr> reviews on the closer alignment of income tax and <abbr title=\"National Insurance contributions\">NICs</abbr> and the taxation of small companies will be published shortly. </p>\n\n<p>Following recommendations by the <abbr title=\"Office of Tax Simplification\">OTS</abbr>, the government will consult on simplifying the tax and <abbr title=\"National Insurance contributions\">NICs</abbr> treatment of termination payments and the tax treatment of travel and subsistence. The government will also consult in autumn 2015 on abolishing Class 2 <abbr title=\"National Insurance contributions\">NICs</abbr> and reforming Class 4 <abbr title=\"National Insurance contributions\">NICs</abbr>.</p>\n\n<p>At March Budget 2015, the government announced it would transform tax administration for individuals and small businesses over this Parliament, leading to the end of the tax return. Small businesses will be able to manage their tax through a digital account linked to business software. <abbr title=\"HM Revenue and Customs\">HMRC</abbr> will begin discussions with businesses and software providers about how best to integrate tax reporting and payment with everyday business activity, to inform a roadmap the government will publish by the end of 2015 setting out the policy and administrative changes needed.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"boosting-productivity\">\n<span class=\"number\">4.2 </span>Boosting productivity</h3>\n\n<p>A more productive economy requires the government to back competitiveness and prioritise investment in infrastructure and human capital. This Budget sets out reforms the government is making to achieve this. The full details of the government’s actions will be set out in the productivity plan.</p>\n\n<p>Supporting enterprise is a priority for the government. This year the government will lay final legislation requiring major UK banks both to share <abbr title=\"Small and medium-sized enterprise\">SME</abbr> credit information with other lenders and to offer to share the details of SMEs rejected for a loan with online platforms that can match them to alternative finance providers. Alongside these reforms, the British Business Bank is increasing and diversifying the supply of finance available to SMEs, and aims to facilitate up to £10 billion of finance by 2019.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"modern-transport-infrastructure\">Modern transport infrastructure</h4>\n\n<p>The government believes that a modern infrastructure network is vital. By 2020-21, this government will have trebled investment in improvements to the national road networks compared to 2012-13 levels, investing over £28 billion in enhancements and maintenance of national and local roads<sup id=\"fnref:76\"><a href=\"#fn:76\" class=\"footnote\">76</a></sup>. To ensure that future roads investment is sustainable, this Budget announces a reform to vehicle excise duty (<abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr>) to create a new Roads Fund. <abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr> will be reformed for cars registered from April 2017 to make it fairer for motorists and reflect improvements in new car CO2 emissions. The new <abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr> system will be reviewed as necessary to ensure that it continues to incentivise the cleanest cars.</p>\n\n<p>From 2020-21 the government guarantees that all revenue raised from <abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr> in England will be allocated to a new Roads Fund and invested directly back into the strategic road network.  Further details of the <abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr> reform are set out in paragraph 2.145.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"chart-121-stabilising-car-ved-revenues-through-reform\">Chart 1.21: Stabilising car <abbr title=\"Vehicle Excise Duty\">VED</abbr> revenues through reform</h4>\n\n<figure class=\"image embedded\">\n  <div class=\"img\"><img alt=\"Chart 1.21\" src=\"https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/41337/960x640_chart121.jpg\"></div>\n</figure>\n\n<p>Demonstrating an ongoing commitment to stable investment, the government will publish a second Road Investment Strategy by the end of this Parliament, building on the first published in December 2014.</p>\n\n<p>Over the last 10 years, rail passenger journeys in Great Britain have increased by 57% and today over 4.3 million journeys are made by rail each day<sup id=\"fnref:77\"><a href=\"#fn:77\" class=\"footnote\">77</a></sup>. To support this level of growth, the government has committed to upgrading the railway and bringing this largely Victorian asset into the 21st century, including by spending £38 billion on the railways over the 5 years to 2019<sup id=\"fnref:78\"><a href=\"#fn:78\" class=\"footnote\">78</a></sup>. As problems at Network Rail have become clear, the government has acted to put the rail investment programme back on track.</p>\n\n<p>Specifically, the government has appointed Sir Peter Hendy, formerly the Commissioner of Transport for London, as the new Chairman of Network Rail. The government has asked Sir Peter Hendy to bring to bear his experience and expertise and do what is necessary to ensure Network Rail can deliver effectively and operate the railways safely, and in particular to report by autumn 2015 with a plan to get the rail investment programme back onto a sustainable footing.</p>\n\n<p>The government will also take further action to improve incentives and drive improvements in Network Rail and the wider rail industry:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>the government has asked Sir Peter Hendy and Mark Carne, Chief Executive of Network Rail to continue with the work started in Network Rail to devolve more power to route managers closer to the front line, so that the railways are more focussed on delivering what passengers need and to drive comparative benchmarking of the efficiency and effectiveness of individual routes – to drive up performance across the network</li>\n  <li>the government will also change the way it channels public money through the industry, directing it through the train operating companies, so that Network Rail focuses firmly on the needs of train operators, and, through them, passengers – this will put the customers of the railway back in the driving seat in demanding efficiency and improvements that matter to them, making the best use of scarce capacity on the rail network</li>\n  <li>the government will introduce a new approach to station redevelopment and commercial land sales on the rail network, building on the experience of regenerating land around Kings Cross Station and Stratford in East London \n– the government will establish a dedicated body to focus on pursuing opportunities to realise value from public land and property assets in the rail network to both maximise the benefit to local communities and reduce the burden of public debt</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Looking further ahead, the government has also asked Nicola Shaw, Chief Executive of High Speed 1, to advise the government on how it should approach the longer-term future shape and financing of Network Rail. Nicola Shaw will work closely with Sir Peter Hendy in conducting her work, which will be concluded before Budget 2016.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"reliable-affordable-and-low-carbon-energy\">Reliable, affordable and low carbon energy</h4>\n\n<p>The government will continue to promote the low carbon investment and innovation needed to support global action on climate change, focussing on the best value for money policies to keep costs down for consumers. The government will push for a global climate deal later this year that keeps the goal of limiting global warming to 2 degrees firmly within reach. </p>\n\n<p>The government also aims to develop a simple, fair and more efficient energy environment for business that minimises administrative burdens and improves incentives for business to invest and grow. The government will review the business energy efficiency tax landscape and consider approaches to simplify and improve the effectiveness of the regime. A consultation will be launched in autumn 2015. </p>\n\n<p>To help reduce costs for energy consumers, the government will publish proposals on extending competitive tendering to onshore electricity transmission assets. This could save consumers around £390 million over the next 10 years<sup id=\"fnref:79\"><a href=\"#fn:79\" class=\"footnote\">79</a></sup>. </p>\n\n<p>The government welcomes the provisional findings of the Competition and Markets Authority’s energy market investigation. It is important that as many consumers as possible are on the best available deal, in order to save money on their energy bill. To help enable this, the government aims to introduce 24 hour switching by the end of 2018 and will also act to improve trust in the switching process.</p>\n\n<p>The government believes in making the most of the UK’s oil and gas resources, including the safe extraction of shale gas. Building on action set out in the March Budget 2015, the government will expand the North Sea investment and cluster area allowances to include additional activities which will maximise economic recovery. The government will also bring forward proposals for a sovereign wealth fund for communities that host shale gas development. </p>\n\n<p>This Budget also announces the removal of the Climate Change Levy exemption for renewable electricity. This change will correct an imbalance in the tax system by preventing taxpayers’ money benefitting renewable electricity generated overseas, and by helping ensure support for low carbon generation provides better value for money for UK taxpayers.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"world-class-universities\">World class universities</h4>\n\n<p>Britain’s universities are one of the jewels in the crown of the economy and are vital to the country’s future. The UK has 4 of the world’s top 10 universities, second only to the US<sup id=\"fnref:80\"><a href=\"#fn:80\" class=\"footnote\">80</a></sup>. </p>\n\n<p>Since 2010 student participation has increased and there is now a higher proportion of students from disadvantaged backgrounds applying to and entering higher education than ever before. The government has also committed for the first time to remove the cap on student numbers, enabling thousands more students to enjoy the returns that higher education brings.</p>\n\n<p>There is evidence that students are more concerned about the level of support they receive while studying than the long-term repayment of their income contingent loans<sup id=\"fnref:81\"><a href=\"#fn:81\" class=\"footnote\">81</a></sup>. Maintenance loan support will rise for students from low and middle income backgrounds up to £8,200 a year for those who are studying away from home, outside London. This is the highest level ever. </p>\n\n<p>But the expansion of higher education relies on funding being put onto a sustainable footing. The government must therefore ask graduates to meet more of the cost of their degrees once they are earning. From the 2016-17 academic year, maintenance grants will be replaced with maintenance loans for new students from England, paid back only when their earnings exceed £21,000 a year, saving £2.5 billion by 2020-21. To ensure that the long term costs of the student loan book remain affordable and transparent, the government will consult on freezing the loan repayment threshold for five years and review the discount rate applied to student loans and other transactions to bring it into line with the government’s long-term cost of borrowing.</p>\n\n<p>Driving up the quality of higher education is also important, and this Budget announces a number of measures to address this. These include allowing institutions offering high teaching quality to increase their tuition fees in line with inflation from 2017-18, with a consultation on the mechanisms to do this. </p>\n\n<p>Supporting the UK’s research base to deliver continued excellence, as well as driving the commercialisation of findings, is a priority for this government. The government will deliver on the science capital commitment, investing £6.9 billion up to 2021 in infrastructure to investigate the great challenges of today, whether domestic, international or in space<sup id=\"fnref:82\"><a href=\"#fn:82\" class=\"footnote\">82</a></sup>. The government will invite universities, cities, LEPs and businesses to map strengths and identify potential areas of strategic focus for different regions through a series of science and innovation audits. The government encourages universities to strengthen local collaboration and will continue to reward proposals which build on regional strengths, including through funding streams such as the Research Partnership Investment Fund. The government will set out further details on this at the Spending Review.</p>\n\n<p>The government has also created an extensive network of Catapult centres bringing together businesses, scientists and engineers to drive the commercialisation of technology. Innovate UK, working with Research Councils, has now identified further areas where a Catapult might be the right way to ensure the UK is at the forefront of commercialising technologies which offer global opportunities, and will come forward with proposals shortly.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"apprenticeships\">Apprenticeships</h4>\n\n<p>The most successful and productive economies in the world are committed to developing vocational skills. That is why the government has committed to significantly increase the quantity and quality of apprenticeships in England to 3 million starts this Parliament, putting control of funding in the hands of employers. </p>\n\n<h4 id=\"chart-122-number-of-employees-attending-training-outside-their-workplace-labour-force-survey\">Chart 1.22: Number of employees attending training outside their workplace: Labour Force Survey</h4>\n\n<figure class=\"image embedded\">\n  <div class=\"img\"><img alt=\"Chart 1.22\" src=\"https://assets.digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/image_data/file/41329/50325-Chart-1.22.jpg\"></div>\n</figure>\n\n<p>This goal will require funding from employers. In recognition of this, the government will introduce a levy on large UK employers to fund the new apprenticeships. This approach will reverse the long-term trend of employer underinvestment in training, which has seen the number of employees who attend a training course away from the workplace fall from 141,000 in 1995 to 18,000 in 2014<sup id=\"fnref:83\"><a href=\"#fn:83\" class=\"footnote\">83</a></sup>. </p>\n\n<p>The levy will support all post-16 apprenticeships in England. It will provide funding that each employer can use to meet their individual needs. The funding will be directly controlled by employers via the digital apprenticeships voucher, and firms that are committed to training will be able to get back more than they put in. There will be formal engagement with business on the implementation of the levy, which will also consider the interaction with existing sector levy boards, and further details will be set out at the Spending Review.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"ensuring-a-truly-national-recovery-1\">\n<span class=\"number\">5. </span>Ensuring a truly national recovery</h2>\n\n<p>The government is committed to delivering a truly national recovery. Over decades, the economy has become unbalanced. Economies like Germany and the US have economic power spread much more evenly. In 2010, London accounted for 28% of UK <abbr title=\"Gross Domestic Product\">GDP</abbr>, whilst Berlin and New York accounted for much smaller shares, at 5% and 7% of their respective national <abbr title=\"Gross Domestic Product\">GDP</abbr><sup id=\"fnref:84\"><a href=\"#fn:84\" class=\"footnote\">84</a></sup>.

It has also set out its plans for delivering English votes on key issues, including tax and spending powers.</p>\n\n<p>Following the publication of the Smith Commission report, the Scotland Bill was introduced to Parliament on 28 May 2015. Discussions have also begun on a revised fiscal framework for the Scottish Government, with the aim of completion by autumn 2015. As a result, the Scottish Parliament will become one of the most powerful devolved legislatures in the world. The Bill ensures that Scotland and the rest of the UK will continue to benefit from the UK’s successful single market, the pooling of resources and the sharing of risks.</p>\n\n<p>The government is committed to taking forward the St David’s Day agreement for Wales to the timetable set out in the Command Paper<sup id=\"fnref:86\"><a href=\"#fn:86\" class=\"footnote\">86</a></sup>. This includes implementing a funding floor at the Spending Review in the expectation that the Welsh Government holds a referendum on the devolution of income tax. </p>\n\n<p>The devolution of Air Passenger Duty (<abbr title=\"Air Passenger Duty\">APD</abbr>) to the Welsh Assembly will continue to be considered alongside the review of options to mitigate the impacts of <abbr title=\"Air Passenger Duty\">APD</abbr> devolution on regional airports. The government is publishing a discussion paper on regional airports alongside the Budget, setting out how some of the options could work<sup id=\"fnref:87\"><a href=\"#fn:87\" class=\"footnote\">87</a></sup>. </p>\n\n<p>Levels of public spending per head in Northern Ireland remain higher than any other UK country or region<sup id=\"fnref:88\"><a href=\"#fn:88\" class=\"footnote\">88</a></sup>. The government and the Northern Ireland Executive remain committed to the objective of rebalancing the Northern Ireland economy. Targeted support has been provided in recent years through the 2013 ‘economic pact’ ‘Building a Prosperous and United Community’, and the significant financial package offered in December 2014 as part of the Stormont House Agreement. This offers £2 billion of additional spending power. It is critical that the Northern Ireland parties deliver on the commitments they made at Stormont House, to ensure that the potential of the Agreement to support recovery and growth is realised<sup id=\"fnref:89\"><a href=\"#fn:89\" class=\"footnote\">89</a></sup>.</p>\n\n<p>This government is also committed to ensuring that where devolved and non-devolved responsibilities overlap and interact, local communities and their leaders play a key role in identifying opportunities for growth. Implementation of the City Deal for Glasgow and the Clyde Valley is now well under way, alongside early stages of work towards the City Deals for Cardiff, Aberdeen and Inverness announced in the March Budget 2015.</p>\n\n<p>The government has announced that it will introduce ‘English votes for English laws’ to ensure a balanced settlement in which every part of the UK has a fair say. But English MPs will now have a veto in Westminster when debating matters that have been devolved to the Scottish Parliament or the Welsh or Northern Ireland Assemblies. The proposals will also give the decisive say over tax measures to MPs whose constituents are affected by those changes once further planned devolution to Scotland takes place. Subject to the approval of the House of Commons, this new process will be in place before the Budget in 2016.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"regional-rebalancing-1\">\n<span class=\"number\">5.2 </span>Regional rebalancing</h3>\n\n<p>The government is committed to raising the long-term rate of growth throughout England. Good progress was made over the last Parliament. By 2015, there were 1.2 million more private sector jobs in England outside London and the South East than in 2010, supported by the government’s investment in transport, science and skills<sup id=\"fnref:90\"><a href=\"#fn:90\" class=\"footnote\">90</a></sup>. According to the latest data, output per head grew faster in the North than in the South in 2013. The North East, North West, West Midlands and Wales all grew faster per head than London and the UK average <sup id=\"fnref:91\"><a href=\"#fn:91\" class=\"footnote\">91</a></sup>. Employment in the North West has risen faster than in any other region over the last year, adding almost 100,000 new jobs<sup id=\"fnref:92\"><a href=\"#fn:92\" class=\"footnote\">92</a></sup>.</p>\n\n<p>In the last Parliament, the government set out regional Long Term Economic Plans. This Budget builds on those plans with further commitments.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"regional-levers-of-growth\">\n<span class=\"number\">5.3 </span>Regional levers of growth</h3>\n\n<h4 id=\"devolution\">Devolution</h4>\n\n<p>To fulfil its commitment to rebalance the economy and further strengthen the Northern Powerhouse, the Budget announces that the government is working towards further devolution deals with the Sheffield City Region, Liverpool City Region, and Leeds, West Yorkshire and partner authorities, to be agreed in parallel with the Spending Review. If agreement is reached, including on an elected mayor working with local leaders to oversee new powers devolved from ministers, these city regions will be granted significant additional powers and the opportunity to take control of their own affairs to support economic growth.</p>\n\n<p>Building on the ground-breaking devolution deal agreed in November 2014, the government is making further progress on devolving powers to Greater Manchester. This includes putting Fire Services under the control of the new directly-elected Mayor, establishing a Greater Manchester Land Commission, granting the city region more powers over planning subject to the agreement of the Cabinet member representing the district in which the power is used, and inviting discussion of how central government and the city region might collaborate further on children’s services and employment programmes. </p>\n\n<p>The government intends to support towns and counties to play their part in growing the economy, offering them the opportunity to agree devolution deals, and providing local people with the levers they need to boost growth. The government is working with towns and counties to make these deals happen and is making good progress towards a deal with Cornwall.</p>\n\n<p>The government welcomes efforts by local areas to strengthen their governance, and strongly supports the recent publication of a West Midlands Statement of Intent for devolution, which sets out ambitious proposals for a strong and coherent West Midlands combined authority<sup id=\"fnref:93\"><a href=\"#fn:93\" class=\"footnote\">93</a></sup>. The government is also pleased to have received two Combined Authority proposals from local authorities in the East Midlands.</p>\n\n<p>The government remains open to any further proposals from local areas for devolution of significant powers in return for a mayor, in time for conclusion ahead of the Spending Review.</p>\n\n<h4 id=\"local-economies\">Local economies</h4>\n\n<p>The government is inviting bids for a new round of Enterprise Zones. The existing Enterprise Zones have supported the creation of over 15,000 jobs throughout England<sup id=\"fnref:94\"><a href=\"#fn:94\" class=\"footnote\">94</a></sup>. This new round will focus on ensuring that all places in England can benefit, including rural areas where appropriate, and the government encourages towns and districts to work with LEPs to develop bids. </p>\n\n<p>To ensure that local areas have a greater say over their own economies, the government will consult on devolving powers on Sunday trading to city mayors and local authorities. This will look at allowing mayors or councils to extend Sunday trading for additional hours within parameters that they would determine.</p>\n\n<p>The government will continue to support community-led growth in coastal areas and this Budget extends the Coastal Communities Fund by at least £90 million until 2020-21. This is subject to confirmation of future funding arrangements which will be determined at Spending Review 2015.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"skills-and-infrastructure\">\n<span class=\"number\">5.4 </span>Skills and infrastructure</h3>\n\n<h4 id=\"skills\">Skills</h4>\n\n<p>The government will also introduce new Regius Professorships in order to recognise excellence in universities across the UK. The government will launch a competition later this year, with a view to making awards in early 2016 to celebrate the Queen’s 90th birthday.</p>\n\n<p>To support innovation throughout the country, the government will invest £23m in 6 Next Generation Digital Economy Centres over 6 sites (London, Swansea, Newcastle, Nottingham, York and Bath), leveraging £22 million of additional funding, and partnering with LEPs, regional councils, and local SMEs. These centres will exploit opportunities across sectors of the digital economy including the creative industries, finance, healthcare and education.</p>\n\n<p>Innovation is key to the UK’s high growth creative industries, where the UK leads the world in areas from cutting-edge visual effects technology to architectural experimental techniques now used globally. Creative industries are worth £76.9 billion of GVA and employ 1.8 million people. The government has introduced new tax reliefs to support the production of high-end television, animation, video games, theatre and children’s television, and expanded the successful film tax relief. As announced at March Budget 2015, the government will introduce a new tax relief for orchestras at a rate of 25% on qualifying expenditure from 1 April 2016.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, to provide specialist higher-level training in sectors that are critical to economic growth, the government has committed to the establishment of a network of National Colleges. Once established the National Colleges will provide high quality professional and technical routes into employment throughout the UK.</p>\n\n<p>All regions of England have particular strengths in science and innovation. The Budget announces that the government will invite universities, LEPs, businesses and cities to work with central government to map strengths and identify potential areas of strategic focus for different regions through a series of science and innovation audits. </p>\n\n<p>The government invites universities to develop proposals for supporting local collaboration, building on successful university collaborative partnership models such as the N8, M6 and GW4, to be supported through funding streams such as the next £400 million round of the Research Partnership Investment Fund, and will set out further details at the Spending Review.  </p>\n\n<h4 id=\"transport\">Transport</h4>\n<p>To support working people across the country, the government will cap regulated rail fares at RPI for the remainder of this Parliament.</p>\n\n<p>The government invested over £40 billion in transport over the last Parliament, and has committed to over £56 billion in transport infrastructure this Parliament. In response to the recent problems at Network Rail, the government has appointed Sir Peter Hendy to get this Parliament’s rail investment programme back on a sustainable footing, alongside other reforms to make Network Rail a more focussed commercial body. In the last Parliament, the government invested £259 million through the ‘pinchpoints’ fund<sup id=\"fnref:95\"><a href=\"#fn:95\" class=\"footnote\">95</a></sup>. The government is now committing a further £3.5 million to address the remaining areas identified through this scheme, including £2 million for the Treluswell Junction improvement in Cornwall, and £1.5 million for the A4123 Birmingham New Road / Shaw Road Junction to help unlock the development of housing on 6 sites in Wolverhampton. In addition, the government is committing £14 million to local road maintenance improvements; £5.5 million for maintenance and upgrade of the Swanswell Viaduct, £3 million for Tameside Metropolitan Borough Council to make structural improvements to walls around local roads and £5.8 million for the A666 Highways Maintenance Scheme in Bolton. </p>\n\n<p>The government will run a further round of the New Stations Fund with up to £20 million in total available for projects. </p>\n\n<p><a rel=\"external\" href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/hmtreasury/19330372210\">Figure 1: Boosting investment across the UK</a></p>\n\n<h3 id=\"northern-powerhouse\">\n<span class=\"number\">5.5 </span>Northern Powerhouse</h3>\n\n<p>In the last parliament, the government committed to build a Northern Powerhouse. The Northern Powerhouse is a vision based on the solid economic theory that while the individual cities and towns of the north are strong, if they are enabled to pool their strengths, they could be stronger than the sum of their parts. In 2015, there were 320,000 more people in work in the North than in 2010, approximately equivalent to the population of Wigan, and there were 119,400 more businesses than in 2010<sup id=\"fnref:96\"><a href=\"#fn:96\" class=\"footnote\">96</a></sup>. </p>\n\n<p>Cities require high-quality transport if they are to be successful, as well as the powers to deliver a fully integrated public transport system that truly serves the needs of their residents and businesses. The government also recognises that transport plays a vital role outside major city regions in meeting the needs of local communities as well as driving economic growth. The government is committed to significant transport devolution in all of the country’s city regions that elect a Mayor, as well as the country’s counties. This includes the roll-out of Oyster-style smart and integrated ticketing systems that will provide people with quicker and easier door-to-door journeys, greater choice, as well as simpler and more flexible fares. </p>\n\n<p>Building on the government’s commitments set out in Chapter 2 to improve transport connections throughout the country, the government is launching an ambitious new transport devolution package for the North to take the Northern Powerhouse to the next stage and create a single northern economy that is genuinely stronger than the sum of its parts. Building on the Northern Transport Strategy that was jointly published by the government and Transport for the North (<abbr title=\"Transport for the North\">TfN</abbr>) earlier this year, the government is now committing to: </p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>devolving far reaching powers over transport to the North’s Mayor-led city regions to deliver fully integrated public transport systems, supported by smart and integrated ticketing technology</li>\n  <li>establishing <abbr title=\"Transport for the North\">TfN</abbr> as a statutory body with statutory duties to set out its transport policies and investment priorities in a long-term transport strategy for the North, underpinned by £30 million of additional funding over three years to support <abbr title=\"Transport for the North\">TfN</abbr>’s running costs and enable them to advance their work programme</li>\n  <li>appointing an interim Chief Executive and executive team for <abbr title=\"Transport for the North\">TfN</abbr> by autumn 2015 to accelerate <abbr title=\"Transport for the North\">TfN</abbr>’s work programme, and appointing a Chair by the end of the 2015, with an update on the Northern Transport Strategy to be published by Budget 2016 \n-working with <abbr title=\"Transport for the North\">TfN</abbr> to advance the introduction of Oyster-style smart and integrated ticketing across bus, tram, metro and rail services throughout the region, making this one of the top priorities for <abbr title=\"Transport for the North\">TfN</abbr>’s newly accelerated work programme\n-working with <abbr title=\"Transport for the North\">TfN</abbr> to push forward plans to transform east-west rail and road connections via TransNorth and options for a new TransPennine Tunnel, with a prioritised list of scheme options to be produced by Budget 2016, and an interim report in time for the Spending Review later in 2015</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The government is improving road connectivity in the North by upgrading the A628 and dualling the A61, and by upgrading the final stretch of the M1/A1 route between Newcastle and London to motorway. The government will look into the case for renaming the A1(M) north of Leeds as the M1. The A1 will be dualled north of Newcastle as far as Ellingham, and access to the Port of Immingham will be improved with upgrades to the A160/A180.</p>\n\n<p>The government is looking at extending Mersey Gateway bridge toll discounts to residents of Chester West &amp; Chester and Warrington, with final decisions to be made in early 2016. In addition, the government will work with relevant local partners carrying out a review of the tolls on the Mersey tunnels. </p>\n\n<p>The government is making good progress to deliver Health North, which will go live in autumn 2015. It is creating ‘Connected Health Cities’ across the North, assembling experts and technology to provide better care for patients promoting innovation through analysis of data on the effectiveness of different drugs, treatments and health pathways. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"midlands--engine-for-growth\">\n<span class=\"number\">5.6 </span>Midlands – Engine for Growth</h3>\n\n<p>The government is committed to backing the Midlands to ensure it is Britain’s engine for growth. The government will build on the progress made in the Midlands during the course of the last Parliament when 83,300 more businesses were created in the Midlands, and the claimant count was halved<sup id=\"fnref:97\"><a href=\"#fn:97\" class=\"footnote\">97</a></sup>.</p>\n\n<p>The government reaffirms its commitment to £5.2 billion of transport investment in the Midlands in this Parliament. To support the development of a pan-regional transport approach in the Midlands, the government is committing £5 million of additional funding for Midlands Connect to help develop its vision and strategy for transforming transport connectivity across the region in order to drive economic growth.</p>\n\n<p>The extended round of the New Stations Fund will be used to support a local bid for stations on the Robin Hood Line to Edwinstowe and Ollerton, subject to a business case.</p>\n\n<p>Andy Street, Chair of the Greater Birmingham and Solihull <abbr title=\"Local Enterprise Partnership\">LEP </abbr>(GBSLEP), has championed the opportunity to maximise the local benefits of <abbr title=\"High Speed 2\">HS2</abbr> for the area. This includes the extension of the Midlands Metro. Work on the next phase of the extension, taking it to New Street Station, is currently in construction and due to be completed by the end of the year. Further extensions to the east and west of New Street Station are in the programme for delivery over the next few years. The ambition to extend the Metro even further is a key part of the GBSLEP <abbr title=\"High Speed 2\">HS2</abbr> Growth Strategy and the government looks forward to considering proposals when they have been developed further.  </p>\n\n<p>In the Long Term Economic Plan for the Midlands, the Chancellor committed to working with the Midlands LEPs to support a regional approach to skills. The government will work with LEPs, the local partners and the emerging combined authorities to scale up this work across the Midlands, looking to agree a clear and detailed delivery plan in autumn 2015.</p>\n\n<p>The government supports the extension of the Birmingham Enterprise Zone, which will support Birmingham to build on the government’s investment in <abbr title=\"High Speed 2\">HS2</abbr> to generate further benefits for the city of Birmingham, and will consider a business case as part of the Spending Review. </p>\n\n<p>In February 2015, the government announced a new partnership between the Birmingham and Solihull LEP and Jobcentre Plus to invest in additional work coaches to help all local jobseekers to find good jobs. The government is creating a new Jobcentre Plus Employment Advisor role, working with schools and sixth-form colleges to improve young people’s understanding of the local labour market, the skills local employers are looking for, and routes into work. The programme will start in Birmingham, ensuring that young people in the city can benefit from the strong partnerships already in place, before expanding to the wider Greater Birmingham and Solihull area and beyond. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"east-of-england\">\n<span class=\"number\">5.7 </span>East of England</h3>\n\n<p>The government’s long-term economic plan for the East backs the region’s strengths in science and technology, the rural economy, agritech and defence, all reliant on good local transport. </p>\n\n<p>The government will invest £4.2 billion in transport infrastructure and £1.5 billion in roads in the East of England over this Parliament. Work on the Lowestoft Third River Crossing and Ipswich Wet Dock Crossing will be taken forward, with £4 million committed so far. The government will improve rail passenger journey times between London and the East of England, backing the ‘Ipswich in 60’ and ‘Norwich in 90’ rail plans. </p>\n\n<p>Highways England and Essex County Council will work together to study options for dualling the A120 between Braintree and Marks Tey.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"south-west\">\n<span class=\"number\">5.8 </span>South West</h3>\n\n<p>In the long-term economic plan to increase growth and create jobs in the South West, the government set out its plans to invest in transport and support key regional strengths, including defence, cyber security, science, agriculture and tourism. </p>\n\n<p>The government reaffirms its commitment to £7.2 billion investment in transport infrastructure in the South West over this Parliament. The government will provide local councils with funding to support the development of business cases for the North Devon Link Road, and the A391 in Cornwall. </p>\n\n<p>The new round of the New Stations Fund will consider any local proposals for a new station between Castle Cary and Taunton.</p>\n\n<p>To support connectivity in the South West, the government will allocate up to £10 million to the broadband programme from April 2016. The fund will be available for local projects to bid into, with priority given to those delivering ultrafast speeds of 100mbps and above. Broadband Delivery UK will start working with local projects immediately to determine the most effective way of delivering this support.</p>\n\n<p>Small cider makers are a traditional part of rural economies who help create a diverse and vibrant cider market. The UK is discussing reforms to <abbr title=\"European Union\">EU</abbr> law with the <abbr title=\"European Union\">EU</abbr> Commission and other Member States, so that it explicitly allows Member States to support small cider makers through the duty regime. The government is also looking at alternatives that could apply. The government will work with industry on both of these. The government will retain the current duty exemption for small cider producers until and unless a replacement scheme is established.</p>\n\n<p>The government supports the work towards building a new stadium for Cornwall, and looks forward to seeing further progress. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"london\">\n<span class=\"number\">5.9 </span>London</h3>\n\n<p>The government believes that re-balancing the economy means building up every part of the country. London’s growth supports the growth of the whole UK. The government will build on its long term economic plan for London that supports transport, housing and culture. </p>\n\n<p>As one of the 6 Next Generation Digital Economy Centres, the government will invest £4 million in a UK Regions Digital Research Facility at UCL, which has leveraged £5.6 million in additional funding.</p>\n\n<p>The government reaffirms its commitment to supporting £10 billion of transport investment in London over this Parliament. </p>\n\n<p>The government welcomes Professor Dame Ann Dowling’s review into how the UK’s research base can further collaborate with industry. The government will respond in full by the Spending Review, including on how to deliver the central recommendation of making it easier for business to find support from universities and the government’s broad range of financial support. The government can confirm significant industrial support for specific science investments, including £128 million in the UK Collaboration for Research in Infrastructure and Cities (<abbr title=\"UK Collaboratorium for Research in Infrastructure and Cities\">UKCRIC</abbr>), with its hub to be established in London.</p>\n\n<p>London is a leading global city of culture and the government is supportive of the Museum of London’s ambition to move from London Wall to Smithfield General Market.

Critical to supporting the South East and the South Coast is investment in infrastructure.</p>\n\n<p>The government is upgrading domestic rail services to bring Ramsgate within an hour of London. The Department for Transport has asked the rail industry to include extending High Speed 1 services to Hastings and Rye in the forthcoming Kent Route Study. The outputs from this study will be presented to the government for consideration in 2016, with a view to this work being an option for funding after 2019.</p>\n\n<p>The government will extend the scope of the Lewes-Uckfield study to look at improving rail links between London and the south coast, including upgrades to existing routes, consideration of the Brighton Main Line corridor, and re-examination of the <abbr title=\"Department for Transport\">DfT</abbr>’s feasibility study on BML2.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"budget-policy-decisions\">\n<span class=\"number\">6. </span>Budget policy decisions</h2>\n\n<p>Chapter 1 explains how the measures announced in this Budget advance the government’s long-term economic plan.

This measure of the government’s cash requirement is used in the financing arithmetic as it reflects the forecast cash requirement of the Exchequer. The relationship between public sector net borrowing and the <abbr title=\"Central government net cash requirement\">CGNCR</abbr> (ex <abbr title=\"Northern Rock Asset Management\">NRAM</abbr>, <abbr title=\"Bradford and Bingley plc\">B&amp;B</abbr> and <abbr title=\"Network Rail\">NR</abbr>) is set out in the <abbr title=\"Office for Budget Responsibility\">OBR</abbr>’s July 2015 <abbr title=\"Economic and fiscal outlook\">EFO</abbr>.</p>\n\n<p>The net financing requirement (<abbr title=\"Net Financing Requirement\">NFR</abbr>) comprises the <abbr title=\"Central government net cash requirement\">CGNCR</abbr> (ex <abbr title=\"Northern Rock Asset Management\">NRAM</abbr>, <abbr title=\"Bradford and Bingley plc\">B&amp;B</abbr> and <abbr title=\"Network Rail\">NR</abbr>) plus any financing for gilt redemptions, planned financing for the reserves and other adjustments, less the net contribution to financing from National Savings and Investments (<abbr title=\"National Savings and Investments\">NS&amp;I</abbr>) and any other in-year contributions to financing. </p>\n\n<p>The <abbr title=\"Net Financing Requirement\">NFR</abbr> for 2015-16 is projected to be £123.9 billion, a reduction of £14.0 billion relative to that anticipated in April 2015. The change solely reflects the reduction in the <abbr title=\"Office for Budget Responsibility\">OBR</abbr>’s forecast for the <abbr title=\"Central government net cash requirement\">CGNCR</abbr> (ex <abbr title=\"Northern Rock Asset Management\">NRAM</abbr>, <abbr title=\"Bradford and Bingley plc\">B&amp;B</abbr> and <abbr title=\"Network Rail\">NR</abbr>) of £14.0 billion to £71.6 billion, arising from:</p>\n\n<p>• reductions in public sector net borrowing for 2015-16</p>\n\n<p>• income from asset sales including Lloyds, <abbr title=\"Royal Bank of Scotland\">RBS</abbr> and Royal Mail</p>\n\n<p>The majority of the reduction to the <abbr title=\"Net Financing Requirement\">NFR</abbr> will be accommodated by a change in the planned end-year stock of Treasury bills. There will be a net reduction in the Treasury bill stock of £10.5 billion relative to the previously planned stock of £72.0 billion, taking the planned end‑March 2016 Treasury bill stock to £61.5 billion.</p>\n\n<p>Planned gilt sales in 2015-16 will be reduced by £3.5 billion to £127.4 billion. This will be accommodated through a reduction in planned average auction sizes. The updated financing arithmetic is set out in Table A.1.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"gilt-issuance-by-maturity-type-and-method\">\n<span class=\"number\">7.2 </span>Gilt issuance by maturity, type and method</h3>\n\n<p>Auctions will remain the government’s primary method of gilt issuance. In 2015-16, it is anticipated that:</p>\n\n<p>• £99.2 billion (77.9% of total issuance) will be issued by auction</p>\n\n<p>• £24.5 billion (19.2% of total issuance) will be issued by syndication</p>\n\n<p>In addition:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>£1.0 billion (0.8% of total issuance) has been issued by mini-tender</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>£2.7 billion (2.1% of total issuance) remains outstanding from an initially unallocated portion of supplementary issuance of £4.0 billion, to be delivered via syndication or mini-tender</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>The maturity skew of gilt issuance by auction and syndication was previously set out in April 2015. This skew will remain broadly unchanged:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>short maturity conventional gilt issuance by auction will fall by £0.9 billion to £32.3 billion (25.4% of total issuance)</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>medium maturity conventional gilt issuance by auction will fall by £0.8 billion to £25.4 billion (19.9% of total issuance)</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>long maturity conventional gilt issuance by auction will fall by £0.9 billion, however an additional £1.0 billion was allocated to long maturity conventional gilts via a mini-tender in June 2015. Taking this into account, long maturity conventional issuance will now increase by £0.1 billion to £36.8 billion (28.9% of total issuance)</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>index-linked gilt issuance by auction will fall by £0.9 billion, however an additional £0.3 billion was allocated to index-linked gilts via a syndication in June 2015. Taking this into account, index-linked gilt issuance will now fall by £0.6 billion to £30.2 billion (23.7% of total issuance)</p>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"reserves\">\n<span class=\"number\">7.3 </span>Reserves</h3>\n\n<p>The financing arithmetic provides for £5.3 billion of sterling financing for the Official Reserves in 2015-16, as set out in the Revision to the <abbr title=\"Debt Management Office\">DMO</abbr>’s Financing Remit 2015-16, 23 April 2015. This is £0.7 billion less than planned at March Budget 2015, reflecting an offsetting increase in financing in 2014-15 due to increased investments in reserve assets being brought forward at the end of the 2014-15 financial year. </p>\n\n<p>The government is planning on the basis of sterling financing for the Official Reserves of £6.0 billion per year on average, over the 4 years from 2016-17 up to, and including, 2019‑20, thereafter the government has adopted a neutral assumption. This additional financing, announced at Autumn Statement 2014, is intended to ensure that the level of foreign currency reserves held is sufficient for the UK to remain resilient to possible future shocks.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"national-savings-and-investments\">\n<span class=\"number\">7.4 </span>National Savings and Investments</h3>\n\n<p><abbr title=\"National Savings and Investments\">NS&amp;I</abbr> has a net financing target, which remains at £10.0 billion in 2015-16, within a range of £8.0 to £12.0 billion. This target accommodates sales of <abbr title=\"National Savings and Investments\">NS&amp;I</abbr>’s market-leading bonds for people aged 65 and over (the ‘65+ bond’) in 2015-16, as well as the increase in the Premium Bond limit from £40,000 to £50,000 from 1 June 2015. </p>\n\n<h4 id=\"table-a1-financing-arithmetic-in-2015-16\">Table A.1: Financing arithmetic in 2015-16</h4>\n\n<table>\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>£ billion</th>\n      <th>Apr-15</th>\n      <th>Summer Budget 2015</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>\n<abbr title=\"Central government net cash requirement\">CGNCR</abbr> (ex <abbr title=\"Northern Rock Asset Management\">NRAM</abbr>, <abbr title=\"Bradford and Bingley plc\">B&amp;B</abbr> and <abbr title=\"Network Rail\">NR</abbr>)</td>\n      <td>85.6</td>\n      <td>71.6</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Gilt redemptions</td>\n      <td>70.2</td>\n      <td>70.2</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Planned financing for the reserves</td>\n      <td>5.3</td>\n      <td>5.3</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Financing adjustment carried forward from previous financial years</td>\n      <td>-13.1</td>\n      <td>-13.1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Gross financing requirement</td>\n      <td>148.1</td>\n      <td>134.1</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Less:</td>\n      <td> </td>\n      <td> </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Contribution from National Savings and Investments</td>\n      <td>10.0</td>\n      <td>10.0</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Other financing (1)</td>\n      <td>0.2</td>\n      <td>0.2</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Net financing requirement (<abbr title=\"Net Financing Requirement\">NFR</abbr>) for Debt Management Office (<abbr title=\"Debt Management Office\">DMO</abbr>)</td>\n      <td>137.9</td>\n      <td>123.9</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Financed by:</td>\n      <td> </td>\n      <td> </td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>1.

The bond between our countries has been forged, in peace and war, notably through two World Wars, and in almost every major conflict for more than a century, including in Afghanistan and Libya. Together, we have prevailed in the face of adversity and challenge, fighting side by side against tyranny and in defence of freedom.</p>\n\n<p>Our common history, our tradition of parliamentary democracy, our shared values, and our partnership on global issues is what binds us together. We have contributed to our mutual development as prosperous and democratic nations—and we stand together as the only two countries that are members of NATO, the G8, the G20 and the Commonwealth. </p>\n\n<p>Today, our two countries jointly face two major challenges in particular: confronting global economic uncertainty and volatility; and supporting the people of the Middle East and North Africa, who are seeking to build inclusive and stable societies, underpinned by democracy, human rights and the rule of law. </p>\n\n<p>As we move forward in addressing these and other challenges, we commit to renewing our bilateral relationship. To this end, over the coming months we will focus on prosperity, security and development cooperation. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"increasing-economic-growth-trade-and-innovation\">\n<span class=\"number\">0.1 </span>Increasing Economic Growth, Trade and Innovation</h3>\n\n<p>We will work together and through wider cooperation in the G20 to safeguard our mutual prosperity. We will rigorously promote global efforts to ensure strong, sustainable and balanced growth, sound fiscal management, healthy financial sectors and regulatory systems, open markets and productivity-enhancing structural reforms. Our aim is to improve global economic conditions so that enhanced international trade and investment can thrive.</p>\n\n<p>As an important part of this endeavour, we will seek an ambitious and mutually successful outcome to the negotiation of the Canada-EU Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement (CETA). This will result in economic growth for both countries, by stimulating competition, increasing trade, expanding market access and promoting joint investment and innovation. </p>\n\n<p>We look forward to concluding a joint innovation statement leveraging existing resources to facilitate late-stage research collaborations, stimulate commercialisation partnerships, and foster an entrepreneurial community between our countries in order to drive economic growth and address global challenges. </p>\n\n<p>In order to fully realise the inherent power of cyberspace to enhance global economic growth, we will pursue common approaches to cyber security that ensures we develop policies and responses that are fully compatible and mutually reinforcing.</p>\n\n<p>Exploiting the fact that Canada and the UK are global leaders in health research, including regenerative medicine and cell therapy, we will use existing initiatives and mechanisms to foster collaboration, facilitating the translation of our advanced knowledge into life-changing therapies that will benefit our patients, healthcare institutions and industries.</p>\n\n<p>We will encourage the development of technology systems necessary for commercial-scale electricity production from marine energy. We plan to lead the world in moving forward from pilot wave and tidal energy devices to exploring actual power generation stations connected to our respective electricity grids.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"securing-our-countries\">\n<span class=\"number\">0.2 </span>Securing our Countries</h3>\n\n<p>We will continue to work with Afghan and international partners to help build a more viable country that is better governed, more stable and secure, and never again a safe haven for terrorists. Through the training of Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF), regional diplomacy, and development assistance, we are working to help enable the transition of security in Afghanistan to the ANSF by the end of 2014.</p>\n\n<p>We will create greater interoperability between our defence forces and deepen cooperation on procurement and capabilities, to be enabled in part by a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on Defence Material Cooperation, existing MoUs and the ‘Partners in Defence’ dialogue, which will draw on the lessons of current and recent national and NATO-led operations. </p>\n\n<p>We will strengthen our counter-terrorism collaboration, in particular in the Horn of Africa, the Sahel and South Asia, including our efforts to tackle terrorist finance activity in third countries. We will advance shared objectives on migration, including through the Five Country Conference on biometric and other information sharing and service delivery partnerships.</p>\n\n<p>Building on the excellent relationship following evacuations of our nationals from Libya and Egypt this year, we will improve cooperation on consular services through joint contingency planning in third countries, and through staff exchanges between our Crisis Centres.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"promoting-our-shared-values\">\n<span class=\"number\">0.3 </span>Promoting our Shared Values</h3>\n\n<p>Our two militaries have fought side by side to support the will and ambitions of peoples who could not defend themselves. We have successfully supported and defended the right of the Libyan people to choose their own future. We will continue to work closely with the National Transitional Council, recognised by us as the legitimate government authority in Libya, in postconflict stabilisation and the establishment of democracy.</p>\n\n<p>We will also continue to work together, and with our regional and international partners, to support and sustain the democratic reforms underway in the Middle East and North Africa, which are helping build more stable and inclusive societies, underpinned by democratic governance, respect for human rights, freedom of religion, the rule of law, and economies that can respond to the basic needs and aspirations of citizens. </p>\n\n<p>We will work towards a reinvigorated Commonwealth, primarily focusing on its core competency of promoting democracy, good governance, human rights, including freedom of religion, and the rule of law: and by working to collaborate on the adoption and implementation of the recommendations of the Eminent Persons Group report. </p>\n\n<p>We will protect the most vulnerable by working to meet the Millennium Development Goals through development cooperation. We will use effective, results-based development assistance to tackle conflict, ensure food security, foster sustainable economic growth, empower women and protect the health of mothers and children. </p>\n\n<p>We will increase the number of participants in our Youth Mobility programmes, ensuring we foster the next generation’s links between our countries.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"strengthening-our-partnership-for-results\">\n<span class=\"number\">0.4 </span>Strengthening our Partnership for Results</h3>\n\n<p>We commit ourselves and our governments to achieve what we have set out in this declaration to collaborate on our commerce, foreign policy, defence, security, development and intelligence relationship.</p>\n\n<p>We ask Ministers to meet each year to review and report on progress, and to renew objectives for deepening the relationship. This will thus remain a living document, responsive to evolving events, challenges and opportunities.</p>\n\n<p>Endorsed in Ottawa this 22nd day of September, 2011.</p>\n\n<p>The Rt. Hon. Stephen Harper MP \nPrime Minister of Canada</p>\n\n<p>The Rt. Hon. David Cameron MP\nPrime Minister of the United Kingdom\nof Great Britain and Northern Ireland</p></div>",

with <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/pip\">Personal Independence Payment</a> (<abbr title=\"Personal Independence Payment\">PIP</abbr>). We have introduced Personal Independence Payment, which is designed to better reflect today’s understanding of disability, particularly on mental health and fluctuating conditions, and to focus support on those in greatest need.
