## HTML5

* Always quote attribute values - the decision tree for remember when to
  selectively quote is too much mental overhead, so just quote them
* Always use well-formed HTML - implicitly closed elements such as
  `<p>` cause unnecessary parsing overhead and can cause issues in
  accessibility

## Use [ARIA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA) roles appropriately

### Guidance on using [ARIA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA) landmarks

When you use HTML5 sectioning elements it's a good idea to include
the appropriate [ARIA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA) landmark roles as well. The trick when you're
using both HTML5 and [ARIA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA) is to put the landmark on the sectioning
element itself because this avoids the information being duplicated by
screen readers that support both technologies.

Example:

    <header role="banner"></header>

The following roles map directly to HTML5 sectioning elements:

* `role="main"` maps to the `<main>` element
* `role="complementary"` maps to the `<aside>` element
* `role="contentinfo"` maps to the `<footer>` element
* `role="navigation"` maps to the `<nav>` element

[This article from LÃ©onie Watson](http://tink.uk/screen-readers-aria-roles-html5-support/) explains why using ARIA landmark roles in this way delivers the best experience for screen reader users.

For a more comprehensive guide to the mapping of roles to HTML5 sectioning elements read this [guide](http://blog.paciellogroup.com/2013/02/using-wai-aria-landmarks-2013/) from the Paciello Group.

The following landmark roles don't map to HTML5 elements, but are
still good to use:

* `role="search"`
* `role="application"`

## Main content

The `<main>` tag should be used to identify the main content of your page. Support for it is still marginal so ensure to add the `role="main"` attribute.

## Sectioned content

When using the `<section>` tag, add an `aria-labelledby` attribute linking to the id of the heading that identifies that section.

Example:

    <section aria-labelledby="advice">
      <h1 id="advice">Help and advice</h1>

## Navigational elements

When using the `<nav>` tag, add the ARIA landmark `role="navigation"`.

The detail of using the `<nav>` tag is covered in this [blog post](https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2013/07/03/rethinking-navigation/).

### Emphasis

If you want to give the current location emphasis within a navigational list, use a `<strong>` tag.

Example:

    <nav role="navigation">
      <ol>
        <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
        <li><a href="/business">Business</a></li>
        <li><strong>Business Rates</strong></li>
      </ol>
    </nav>

It's semantically more accurate to use `<strong>` than `<em>` and this usage is a reasonably common convention.

When following this pattern ensure the text is of reasonable length. Too much text marked up in either tag can become difficult to read in some instances.
