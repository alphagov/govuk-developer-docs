# GOV.UK Developer Docs

ðŸ‘‰ https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk

This is a static site generated with Middleman, using [alphagov/tech-docs-template](https://github.com/alphagov/tech-docs-template).

Some of the files (like the CSS, javascripts and layouts) are managed in the template and are not supposed to be modified here. Any project-specific
Ruby code needs to go into `/app`.

## Technical documentation

You can use the [GOV.UK Docker environment](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-docker) to run the application and its tests with all the necessary dependencies. Follow [the usage instructions](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-docker#usage) to get started.

**Use GOV.UK Docker to run any commands that follow.**

### Running the app

```
./startup.sh
```

The docs include pages pulled from other GitHub repositories. By default, all these "proxy" pages are pulled when you start the app, which can lead to rate limit error. Using a GitHub API token avoids this.

[Create a GitHub auth token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) (the token doesn't need any permissions).

Store the token in a `.env` file like this:

```
GITHUB_TOKEN=somethingsomething
```

Alternatively, you can also disable proxy pages temporarily e.g.

```
env SKIP_PROXY_PAGES=true ./startup.sh
```

Disabling proxy pages means you'll get a "Not Found" error if you try to access them locally.

You can test the GitHub OAuth aspects of the Developer Docs by running the startup script above in one shell, and then running the following in another shell:

```
OAUTH2_PROXY_CLIENT_ID=abc123456 OAUTH2_PROXY_CLIENT_SECRET=def789101112 ./startup_local_auth.sh
```

You'll need to swap out the client ID and secret. Create an OAuth app at <https://github.com/settings/developers>, with a Homepage URL of <http://localhost:8088> and an Authorization Callback URL of <http://localhost:8088/oauth2/callback>.

Try visiting `http://localhost:8088/private/example.html` and you'll be prompted to sign in with GitHub.

### Testing the app

```
bundle exec rake
```

### Updating the template

You can pull down the latest version of the Tech Docs template by running:

```sh
bin/update
```

### Deployment

This project is hosted on GitHub Pages. It is [redeployed hourly on weekdays][actions]
(to pick up changes to external docs) and whenever a PR is merged.

As part of the deployment, we build a static set of pages to minimise the response time
and potential issues with remote API calls.

```sh
NO_CONTRACTS=true bundle exec middleman build
```

This will create a bunch of static files in `/build`.
