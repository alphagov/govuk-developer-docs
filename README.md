# GOV.UK Developer Docs

ðŸ‘‰ https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/

This is a static site generated with Middleman, using [alphagov/tech-docs-template](https://github.com/alphagov/tech-docs-template).

Some of the files (like the CSS, javascripts and layouts) are managed in the template and are not supposed to be modified here. Any project-specific Ruby code needs to go into `/app`.

## Run the app locally

Run govuk-developer-docs either inside or outside govuk-docker, configuring its behaviour with the ENV variables below.

### ENV variables

- `GITHUB_TOKEN=<your private token>` - token to use to make authenticated requests to GitHub's API. Authenticated requests have a much higher rate limit. *You _will_ need to specify a `GITHUB_TOKEN` if you want to build the entire Developer Docs site*. [Create the token on GitHub](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) (the token doesn't need any scopes).
- `SKIP_PROXY_PAGES=true` - avoid fetching remote 'docs/' for each repo (i.e. just build the docs that live within govuk-developer-docs itself). You can use this if you don't have a `GITHUB_TOKEN` or if you don't care about including the remote docs.
- `NO_CONTRACTS=true` - [recommended setting](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-developer-docs/commit/4b624a72761490c8e9b99a1aa7a10371415381e6) for speeding up the site build process

### Run with govuk-docker

govuk-docker doesn't have great support for passing ENV vars into the application startup. You'll need to [edit the docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-docker/blob/ed98d3547708286f534598c78fb5c57ee3c8d112/projects/govuk-developer-docs/docker-compose.yml#L12-L17) to add the necessary ENV vars (e.g. `GITHUB_TOKEN`) under the `environment` property for both the `govuk-developer-docs-app` and `govuk-developer-docs-lite` groups, eg:

```yml
   environment:
      GITHUB_TOKEN: "<fill it in>"
```

1. In govuk-docker:
  1. Edit `govuk-docker/projects/govuk-developer-docs/docker-compose.yml` as above
  1. [make the project](https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/repos/govuk-docker.html#usage)
1. In govuk-developer-docs:
  1. Install the dependencies (`govuk-docker-run bundle install`)
  1. Run the application (`govuk-docker-up`)
  1. Wait until all the GitHub API calls have completed (you'll see `Inspect your site configuration at` in the output). This can take a few minutes.
1. Visit <http://govuk-developer-docs.dev.gov.uk/>

### Run without govuk-docker

1. Install the dependencies (`bundle install`)
1. Start up the site with `./startup.sh` (passing ENV vars on the CLI if necessary)

## Building the project, and running tests

If you just want to create the site (a `build/` directory containing a set of HTML files), but not actually start up the application, you can do so as follows (again, the ENV variables described above apply here too):

```sh
NO_CONTRACTS=true bundle exec middleman build --verbose
```

To run the tests:

```
bundle exec rake
```

## Update to the latest Tech Docs template

```sh
bin/update
```

## Deployment

We host GOV.UK Developer Docs as a static site on GitHub Pages. The [ci.yml] GitHub Actions workflow updates the site automatically:

- when a PR is merged to the default branch
- on an hourly schedule, to pick up changes to docs included from other repos
