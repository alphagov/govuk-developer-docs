# GOV.UK Developer Docs

ðŸ‘‰ https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk

This is a static site generated with Middleman, using [alphagov/tech-docs-template](https://github.com/alphagov/tech-docs-template).

Some of the files (like the CSS, javascripts and layouts) are managed in the template and are not supposed to be modified here. Any project-specific
Ruby code needs to go into `/app`.

## Technical documentation

### Running locally

The first time you'll need to bundle:

```sh
bundle install
```

If you have issues installing mimemagic, you may need to `brew install shared-mime-info`.

To run the app locally:

```sh
./startup.sh
```

The app will appear at [http://localhost:4567/](http://localhost:4567/)

### GitHub token

You will need a GitHub auth token to build the project or run the full test suite,
otherwise you will find yourself rate limited. You can create one here:

https://github.com/settings/tokens/new

It doesn't need any permissions.

Use it like this:

```sh
export GITHUB_TOKEN=somethingsomething
./startup.sh
```

You may find it easier to save the token to a file and then refer to it dynamically:

```sh
GITHUB_TOKEN=$(cat ~/github_token.txt) ./startup.sh
```

### Building the project

Build the site with:

```sh
NO_CONTRACTS=true bundle exec middleman build
```

This will create a bunch of static files in `/build`.

### Testing

`bundle exec rake`

### Updating the template

You can pull down the latest version of the Tech Docs template by running:

```sh
bin/update
```

### Deployment

This project is hosted on GitHub Pages. It is [redeployed hourly on weekdays][actions]
(to pick up changes to external docs) and whenever a PR is merged.
