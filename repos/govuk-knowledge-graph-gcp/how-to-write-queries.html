  <h1 class="page-title">govuk-knowledge-graph-gcp: How to query the Knowledge Graph</h1>

  
<p>Read this guide if <a href="https://gov-search.service.gov.uk">GovSearch</a> app and its corresponding BigQuery table <code>govuk_knowledge_graph.search.page</code> don't meet your needs.</p>
<p>If you already know which tables you might need, read on, but also read the documentation of the queries that create those tables.</p>

</ul>
<p>If you haven't used the data before, it might be worth reading through the section <a href="#useful-context-to-know">Useful context to know</a>.</p>
<p>For worked examples, read the section <a href="#worked-examples">Worked examples</a>.</p>
<p>If you need data about how GOV.UK content has changed over time, or a snapshot of GOV.UK content as it was at a moment in the past, then read about <a href="#the-publishing-api-data-model">the Publishing API Data Model</a> and use the tables in the dataset <code>govuk-knowledge-graph.publishing_api</code>.</p>
<h2 id="useful-context-to-know">Useful context to know</h2>
<h3 id="what-a-page-is">What a 'page' is</h3>
<p>There is no agreed definition of what a 'page' is.  A hand-wavey definition might be "What a browser displays at a given URL."  The <a href="https://gov-search.service.gov.uk">GovSearch</a> app refines this definition as follows (see also the <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-knowledge-graph-gcp/blob/main/terraform/bigquery/search-page.sql">query</a>, which creates the BigQuery table <code>govuk-knowledge-graph.search.page</code>).</p>
<ul>
<li>Chapters of multi-part documents (ones whose <code>document_type</code> is <code>guide</code> or <code>travel_advice</code>) are each a page in their own right.</li>
<li>Pages in a locale other than <code>en</code> are each a page in their own right, even if there exists a corresponding page in the <code>en</code> locale that contains the same content in the English language.</li>
<li>Documents that don't have a URL of their own (such as certain role appointments) are included anyway, because they are sometimes rendered as part of another page.</li>
<li>Redirected pages are excluded.</li>
<li>Pages that display a "Withdrawn" banner are included.</li>
<li>
<a href="https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/repos/content-store/gone_item.html">Gone</a> documents (ones where the browser responds with a 410 'gone' HTTP status, rather than a 404 'not found') are excluded.</li>
<li>URLs recorded in Google Analytics (also known as GA4) that don't exist in GOV.UK (such as when a user puts a typo into the search bar) are excluded.</li>
</ul>
<p>If that definition doesn't suit you, then you probably need to use the <code>govuk-knowledge-graph.public.publishing_api_editions_current</code> table.  Begin by reading the following section on <a href="#the-publishing-api-data-model">The Publishing API Data Model</a>.</p>
<h3 id="the-publishing-api-data-model">The Publishing API Data Model</h3>
<p>The data in the Knowledge Graph is mostly from the GOV.UK Publishing API, which doesn't have a concept of a page, rather it has concepts of <a href="#content-items-documents-and-editions">content items, documents and editions</a>.  See the <a href="https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/repos/publishing-api/model.html">GOV.UK Publishing API documentation</a>, and the <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-knowledge-graph-gcp/blob/main/terraform/bigquery/README-publishing-api-editions-current.md">documentation of the <code>publishing_api_editions_current</code> table</a>.</p>
<p>The different ways that content is removed from the website are described by the concept of <a href="#unpublishings">unpublishings</a>.</p>
<p>The ways that content items are associated with one another (for example, a page is published by an organisation, a person is appointed to a role) are described by the concept of <a href="#links">links</a>.</p>
<h4 id="content-items-documents-and-editions">Content items, documents and editions</h4>
<p>The top-level object is the "content item", which has a unique <code>content_id</code>, and no other metadata.  There is no table of content items, because its only column would be <code>content_id</code>.</p>
<p>Each content item has at least one "document". Each document of a content item is in a different locale.  This is one way that translations are implemented, by creating each translation as a document of the same content item.  Unfortunately, some translations are implemented by creating each translation as a document of a different content item</p>
<p>Each document has at least one "edition", which describes the document. Only the most recent edition is valid. Previous editions record the previous state of that document.  The table <code>govuk-knowledge-graph.private.publishing_api_editions_current</code> contains only the most-recent edition of each document, and the table <code>govuk-knowledge-graph.private.publishing_api_editions_current</code> (<code>public</code> rather than <code>private</code>) contains only those editions that are also publicly available via the website and the GOV.UK Content API.</p>
<p>Not every edition has a URL (recorded in the data as a <code>base_path</code>, which omits the <code>https://www.gov.uk</code> part of each URL).  Editions that lack a URL are usually editions of a content item that represents something like a role appointment, which doesn't have its own page on the web, but is sometimes rendered as part of another page.</p>
<p>Some editions are used to present content at more than one URL.  These are editions whose <code>document_type</code> is <code>guide</code> or <code>travel_advice</code>. For example, the edition whose <code>base_path</code> is <code>/machine-game-duty</code> will be used to present content at each of the following URLs.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/machine-game-duty">https://www.gov.uk/machine-game-duty</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/machine-game-duty/overview">https://www.gov.uk/machine-game-duty/overview</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/machine-game-duty/register">https://www.gov.uk/machine-game-duty/register</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/machine-game-duty/how-much-you-pay">https://www.gov.uk/machine-game-duty/how-much-you-pay</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/machine-game-duty/file-return">https://www.gov.uk/machine-game-duty/file-return</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/machine-game-duty/changes">https://www.gov.uk/machine-game-duty/changes</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, it will be used to present content at any URL that begins with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/machine-game-duty">https://www.gov.uk/machine-game-duty</a>, because its "route" is defined as a "prefix" type in the <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/router">GOV.UK router</a>. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/machine-game-duty/for-example">https://www.gov.uk/machine-game-duty/for-example</a>.</p>
<h4 id="unpublishings">Unpublishings</h4>
<p>See the <a href="https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/repos/publishing-api/model.html#unpublishing">GOV.UK Publishing API documentation</a>.</p>
<p>The table <code>govuk-knowledge-graph.public.publishing_api_unpublishings_current</code> records unpublishings of only those editions that still exist in some form on the website and the GOV.UK Content API.  Consequently, the only types of unpublishings that are in the table are <code>gone</code>, <code>redirect</code> and <code>withdrawal</code>.  The types <code>vanish</code> and <code>substitute</code> are not present, because they link to editions that aren't publicly available.  If you need those records, use the table <code>govuk-knowledge-graph.publishing_api.unpublishings</code>.</p>
<p>'History mode' content is implemented in a different way from unpublishings.  A content item is in history mode if it has been tagged as being 'political', and has a link of type <code>government</code> to previous government. See the related <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-knowledge-graph-gcp/issues/554">GitHub issue</a> and the <a href="#history-mode">worked example</a>.</p>
<h4 id="links">Links</h4>
<p>The table <code>govuk-knowledge-graph.public.publishing_api_links_current</code> abstracts some of the complexity of the <a href="https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/repos/publishing-api/model.html#linking">GOV.UK Publishing API implementation of links</a>.</p>
<p>Links are made between two content items, or between one whole content item and one specific edition of a content item. The table <code>govuk-knowledge-graph.public.publishing_api_links_current</code> resolves every link to a specific edition, which simplifies table joins in SQL.</p>
<p>The only metadata about a link is its <code>type</code> and, optionally, its <code>position</code>.  The position is used to render certain links in a given order, such as a set of links in the sidebar to related pages.</p>
<p>A commonly-used type of link is <code>primary_publishing_organisation</code> and <code>organisations</code>, which records which organisations published a given page.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many pages don't use the links table to record associations with other content, and instead use the <code>details</code> column of their edition, which is a large JSON object that has a different schema according to the edition's <code>schema_name</code>.  See the section <a href="#edition-details">Edition details</a>.</p>
<h4 id="edition-details">Edition details</h4>
<p>Most of the information about a piece of content is in a large JSON object in the <code>details</code> column of the table <code>govuk-knowledge-graph.public.publishing_api-editions-current</code>.  The schema of that JSON object varies according to the <code>schema_name</code> of the editions.  The schemas are available in the <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/publishing-api/tree/main/content_schemas/dist/formats">publishing-api repository</a> and its <a href="https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/content-schemas.html">documentation</a>, and the relevant variant of each schema is the one called <code>publisher_v2</code>.  This sometimes differs slightly from what is used by the GOV.UK Content API, but usually it is easier to view the details of a particular page in the GOV.UK Content API than in BigQuery.  To view a page in the GOV.UK Content API, insert <code>/api/content</code> after <code>https://www.gov.uk</code> in the URL of the page.  For example, the page <a href="https://www.gov.uk/machine-game-duty">https://www.gov.uk/machine-game-duty</a> becomes <a href="https://www.gov.uk/api/content/machine-game-duty">https://www.gov.uk/api/content/machine-game-duty</a>.</p>
<p>See the BigQuery documentation of its <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/json_functions">JSON functions</a> to extract information from the <code>details</code> column.</p>
<h2 id="worked-examples">Worked examples</h2>
<h3 id="pages-with-no-description">Pages with no description</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>To improve site search results, I wanted to find any content items that did not have a description, so I could raise them with the publishers responsible for them.</p>
<p>I only wanted pages that are currently live, and not withdrawn. (I also found that I had to exclude some document types that never have a description.)</p>
<p>I wanted the base path, document type, title, description (to show that itâ€™s empty), primary organisation, all organisations, and page views (to help prioritise more popular content).</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To find out which schemas do not require a <code>description</code>, see the <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/publishing-api/tree/main/content_schemas/dist/formats">publishing-api repository</a> or its <a href="https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/content-schemas.html">documentation</a>, such as the <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-content-schemas/blob/main/dist/formats/contact/publisher_v2/schema.json">contact</a> (<a href="https://docs.publishing.service.gov.uk/content-schemas/contact.html">documentation</a>) schema.</p>
<p>The best dataset to query would be the site search dataset itself.  It isn't among the GovGraph tables, though, so here are some alternatives.</p>
<h4 id="the-govsearch-table">The GovSearch table</h4>
<p>The table <code>govuk-knowledge-graph.search.page</code> includes everything that is in GovSearch, and all the columns required for this query.  See the section <a href="#what-a-page-is">What a 'page' is</a> for details.  A disadvantage is that it currently isn't possible to omit rows that represent sections of multi-part pages, such as <code>guide</code> and <code>travel_advice</code>.</p>
<pre lang="sql"><code>SELECT
  url, -- base path with https://www.gov.uk prepended
  documentType,
  title,
  description,
  primary_organisation,
  organisations,
  page_views

    OR description = '')

<h4 id="not-the-govsearch-table">Not the GovSearch table</h4>
<p>The advantage of using the tables that the GovSearch table <code>govuk-knowledge-graph.search.page</code> is derived from, rather than the GovSearch table itself, is that it becomes possible to omit rows that represent sections of multi-part pages, such as <code>guide</code> and <code>travel_advice</code>. The following query is based on <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-knowledge-graph-gcp/blob/main/terraform/bigquery/search-page.sql">search-page.sql</a>, which is the query that creates the GovSearch table.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Start buttons are links, like any other hyperlink in a page. They are available in the table <code>govuk-knowledge-graph.public.start_button_links</code>, which is created by a <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-knowledge-graph-gcp/blob/main/terraform/bigquery/start-button-links.sql">query</a>. If you can't use that table, then you can find the same data in the table <code>public.publishing_api_editions_current</code>, in the <code>details</code> column, in the fields <code>transaction_start_link</code> and <code>start_button_text</code>, in editions with <code>schema_name = "transaction"</code>.</p>
<p>To get the URL of the page that has a given start button, join onto the <code>public.publishing_api_editions_current</code> table using the ID of the edition, as follows.</p>

<p>You can see how the data of an organisation is structured by finding its web page, and then altering the URL to inspect it in the GOV.UK Content API.  The example above is at <a href="https://www.gov.uk/api/content/government/organisations/hm-courts-and-tribunals-service">https://www.gov.uk/api/content/government/organisations/hm-courts-and-tribunals-service</a>.</p>
<p>From that example, we can see that the <code>schema_name</code> is <code>organisation</code>, so we will filter for editions of that schema.  Because the fields <code>title</code> and <code>analytics_identifier</code> are at the top level of that JSON structure, we expect to find them as columns of the table <code>public.publishing_api_editions_current</code>.  The <code>details</code> field contains <code>organisation_type</code> and <code>acronym</code>, so we would expect to find those in the <code>details</code> column.  The <code>details</code> field also contains <code>organisation_govuk_status</code>, which itself contains <code>status: "live"</code>, which corresponds with the "Organisation State".  The slug will have to be derived from the <code>base_path</code>.</p>
<p>To save on query costs while developing a query like this one (potentially running it several times), first create a table from a subset of the table <code>govuk-knowledge-graph.public.publishing_api_editions_current</code>.  This is only worthwhile when using the <code>details</code> column, which is by far the costliest.</p>

<p>Results typically differ from the Search API because the Search API excludes rather a lot of documents, and presents some of the data differently.  In this case, the Search API seems to derive the fields <code>organisation_state</code> and <code>organisation_closed_state</code> from the Publishing API's <code>organisation_govuk_status.status</code> field.</p>
<h3 id="mainstream-browse">Mainstream browse</h3>
<p>The "mainstream browse taxonomy" (not to be confused with the "taxonomy") is a tree structure for navigating GOV.UK content.  The root of the tree the page /browse. Below /browse are "top-level browse pages", and below those are "second-level browse pages".  The leaves of the tree are normal pages, linked to second-level browse pages.  Each page can have more than one parent.  For example, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/api/content/benefit-overpayments">https://www.gov.uk/api/content/benefit-overpayments</a> is a child of both /browse/benefits/entitlement and /browse/benefits/manage-your-benefit. Only one parent is chosen to be displayed in the breadcrumb links at the top of the page.</p>
<p>The hierarchy (ignoring groups) can be derived as follows.</p>
