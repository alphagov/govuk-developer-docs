## OAuth2 Proxy Config File
## See example config file:
##Â https://github.com/oauth2-proxy/oauth2-proxy/blob/master/contrib/oauth2-proxy.cfg.example

## <addr>:<port> to listen on for HTTP/HTTPS clients
http_address = "127.0.0.1:8088"
# https_address = ":443"

## Are we running behind a reverse proxy? Will not accept headers like X-Real-Ip unless this is set.
reverse_proxy = true

## the http url(s) of the upstream endpoint. If multiple, routing is based on path
upstreams = [
    "http://localhost:4567"
]

## pass HTTP Basic Auth, X-Forwarded-User and X-Forwarded-Email information to upstream
pass_basic_auth = true
pass_user_headers = true
## pass the request Host Header to upstream
## when disabled the upstream Host is used as the Host Header
pass_host_header = true

## Email Domains to allow authentication for (this authorizes any email on this domain)
## for more granular authorization use `authenticated_emails_file`
## To authorize any email addresses use "*"
email_domains = [
    "*"
]

## bypass authentication for requests that match the method & path. Format: method=path_regex OR path_regex alone for all methods
skip_auth_routes = [
  "!=^/private"
]

## Templates
## optional directory with custom sign_in.html and error.html
# custom_templates_dir = ""

## Provider Settings (Github)
provider = "github"
# github_org = "alphagov"
# github_team = ""
# github_repo = ""
# github_token = ""
# github_user = ""


## Cookie Settings
## Name     - the cookie name
## Secret   - the seed string for secure cookies; should be 16, 24, or 32 bytes
##            for use with an AES cipher when cookie_refresh or pass_access_token
##            is set
## Domain   - (optional) cookie domain to force cookies to (ie: .yourcompany.com)
## Expire   - (duration) expire timeframe for cookie
## Refresh  - (duration) refresh the cookie when duration has elapsed after cookie was initially set.
##            Should be less than cookie_expire; set to 0 to disable.
##            On refresh, OAuth token is re-validated.
##            (ie: 1h means tokens are refreshed on request 1hr+ after it was set)
## Secure   - secure cookies are only sent by the browser of a HTTPS connection (recommended)
## HttpOnly - httponly cookies are not readable by javascript (recommended)
cookie_name = "_oauth2_proxy_localhost"
cookie_secret = "N0t4R34LS3cr3t%!"
# cookie_domains = ""
# cookie_expire = "168h"
# cookie_refresh = ""
cookie_secure = false
cookie_httponly = true
