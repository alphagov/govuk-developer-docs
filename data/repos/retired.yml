  - github_repo_name: design-principles
    type: Frontend apps
    retired: true
    puppet_name: designprinciples
    description: |
      A frontend app that used to render the GDS design principles as static
      pages.  This required developer effort to update the content so in
      November 2017 we retired the app after all the content had been replaced
      by a version managed by our publishing apps.

  - github_repo_name: organisations-publisher
    type: Publishing apps
    retired: true
    repo_url: https://github.com/alphagov/organisations-publisher
    description: |
      organisations-publisher was a proposed app to create and edit organisations,
      people and roles, taking over from whitehall. It was never released.

  - github_repo_name: panopticon
    retired: true
    type: Publishing apps
    repo_url: https://github.com/alphagov/panopticon
    description: |
      Application that was at one time used for management of "artefacts", route
      registration, tagging and search indexing. The functionality was slowly moved
      to the new publishing platform during migration (2016/2017). In February 2017
      the last functionality was removed. Most features moved to
      [publishing-api](/apps/publishing-api.html) (like route registration), managing
      of artefacts was moved to [publisher](/apps/publisher.html), and tagging moved
      to [content-tagger](/apps/content-tagger.html). Publishing apps became
      responsible for sending their pages to search.

  - github_repo_name: policy-publisher
    retired: true
    type: Publishing apps
    repo_url: https://github.com/alphagov/policy-publisher
    description: |
      Used to create and edit policies, which were shown at
      https://www.gov.uk/government/policies. This functionality was
      originally extracted from Whitehall in to this app. Then later,
      policy pages were replaced by Topic pages through the work on the
      GOV.UK Topic Taxonomy, removing the need for Policy Publisher.

  - github_repo_name: business-support-api
    retired: true
    type: APIs
    description: |
      API that was used to populate the "business support finder". In May 2017,
      it was replaced with the publishing-api and content-store.

    retired: true
    type: APIs

      translation of Whitehall feed URLs into Govdelivery topics. Retired in favour
      of email-alert-api in September 2017.

  - github_repo_name: govuk_content_api
    retired: true
    type: APIs
    puppet_name: contentapi
    description: |
      API that used to store and serve published content to the rendering applications
      for display from public-facing URLs. This has now been superceded by the
      [content-store](/apps/content-store.html).

  - github_repo_name: govuk_need_api
    retired: true
    type: APIs
    puppet_name: need_api
    description: |
      A JSON read and write API for information about user needs on GOV.UK. It was a Rails
      app which was part of the GOV.UK Publishing Platform. The need information is now
      stored in the Publishing API, and available in the Content Store.

  - github_repo_name: metadata-api
    retired: true
    type: APIs
    description: |
      API written in Go that was used to get user need information about given URLs
      on GOV.UK. The api would communicate with the `needs API` on behalf of
      `info-frontend` and retrieve information about user needs. The responses would
      then be parsed by `metadata-api` and handed over to `info-frontend`. `info-frontend` is
      now getting need information via the `backdrop read API` which it talks to using
      `gds-api-adapters`.
