# Retired applications

- github_repo_name: specialist-frontend
  type: Frontend apps
  retired: true
  description: |
    specialist-frontend was used to render specialist documents. Those were moved
    to government-frontend in April 2017.

- github_repo_name: contacts-frontend
  type: Frontend apps
  retired: true
  description: |
   contacts-frontend used to render the HMRC contacts pages. Since April 2017
   these are rendered by government-frontend.

- github_repo_name: multipage-frontend
  type: Frontend apps
  retired: true
  description: |
    multipage-frontend was used to render travel advice pages. Those were moved
    to government-frontend in March 2017.

- github_repo_name: design-principles
  type: Frontend apps
  retired: true
  puppet_name: designprinciples
  description: |
    A frontend app that used to render the GDS design principles as static
    pages.  This required developer effort to update the content so in
    November 2017 we retired the app after all the content had been replaced
    by a version managed by our publishing apps.

- github_repo_name: organisations-publisher
  type: Publishing apps
  retired: true
  repo_url: https://github.com/alphagov/organisations-publisher
  description: |
    organisations-publisher was a proposed app to create and edit organisations,
    people and roles, taking over from whitehall. It was never released.

- github_repo_name: panopticon
  retired: true
  type: Publishing apps
  repo_url: https://github.com/alphagov/panopticon
  description: |
    Application that was at one time used for management of "artefacts", route
    registration, tagging and search indexing. The functionality was slowly moved
    to the new publishing platform during migration (2016/2017). In February 2017
    the last functionality was removed. Most features moved to
    [publishing-api](/apps/publishing-api.html) (like route registration), managing
    of artefacts was moved to [publisher](/apps/publisher.html), and tagging moved
    to [content-tagger](/apps/content-tagger.html). Publishing apps became
    responsible for sending their pages to search.

- github_repo_name: policy-publisher
  retired: true
  type: Publishing apps
  repo_url: https://github.com/alphagov/policy-publisher
  description: |
    Used to create and edit policies, which were shown at
    https://www.gov.uk/government/policies. This functionality was
    originally extracted from Whitehall in to this app. Then later,
    policy pages were replaced by Topic pages through the work on the
    GOV.UK Topic Taxonomy, removing the need for Policy Publisher.

- github_repo_name: business-support-api
  retired: true
  type: APIs
  description: |
    API that was used to populate the "business support finder". In May 2017,
    it was replaced with the publishing-api and content-store.


- github_repo_name: govuk-delivery
  retired: true
  type: APIs
  description: |
    API that was once used to handle Whitehall email notifications and the
    translation of Whitehall feed URLs into Govdelivery topics. Retired in favour
    of email-alert-api in September 2017.

- github_repo_name: govuk_content_api
  retired: true
  type: APIs
  puppet_name: contentapi
  description: |
    API that used to store and serve published content to the rendering applications
    for display from public-facing URLs. This has now been superceded by the
    [content-store](/apps/content-store.html).

- github_repo_name: govuk_need_api
  retired: true
  type: APIs
  puppet_name: need_api
  description: |
    A JSON read and write API for information about user needs on GOV.UK. It was a Rails
    app which was part of the GOV.UK Publishing Platform. The need information is now
    stored in the Publishing API, and available in the Content Store.

- github_repo_name: metadata-api
  retired: true
  type: APIs
  description: |
    API written in Go that was used to get user need information about given URLs
    on GOV.UK. The api would communicate with the `needs API` on behalf of
    `info-frontend` and retrieve information about user needs. The responses would
    then be parsed by `metadata-api` and handed over to `info-frontend`. `info-frontend` is
    now getting need information via the `backdrop read API` which it talks to using
    `gds-api-adapters`.

- github_repo_name: business-support-finder
  retired: true
  type: Frontend apps
  repo_url: https://github.com/alphagov/business-support-finder
  description: |
    Application that was used to display the "business support finder", an early
    finder-style page with search functionality for finding details of business
    finance support schemes. In March 2017, it was replaced with a new-style finder
    rendered by [finder-frontend](/apps/finder-frontend.html) and published by
    [specialist-publisher](/apps/specialist-publisher.html).
