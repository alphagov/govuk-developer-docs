    Application that was at one time used for management of "artefacts", route
    registration, tagging and search indexing. The functionality was slowly moved
    to the new publishing platform during migration (2016/2017). In February 2017
    the last functionality was removed. Most features moved to
    [publishing-api](/apps/publishing-api.html) (like route registration), managing
    of artefacts was moved to [publisher](/apps/publisher.html), and tagging moved
    to [content-tagger](/apps/content-tagger.html). Publishing apps became
    responsible for sending their pages to search.

    finder-style page with search functionality for finding details of business
