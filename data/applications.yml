    Application that was at one time used for management of "artefacts", route
    registration, tagging and search indexing. The functionality was slowly moved
    to the new publishing platform during migration (2016/2017). In February 2017
    the last functionality was removed. Most features moved to
    [publishing-api](/apps/publishing-api.html) (like route registration), managing
    of artefacts was moved to [publisher](/apps/publisher.html), and tagging moved
    to [content-tagger](/apps/content-tagger.html). Publishing apps became
    responsible for sending their pages to search.

  type: APIs
  description: |
    API written in Go that was used to get user need information about given URLs
    on GOV.UK. The api would communicate with the `needs API` on behalf of
    `info-frontend` and retrieve information about user needs. The responses would
    then be parsed by `metadata-api` and handed over to `info-frontend`. `info-frontend` is
    now getting need information via the `backdrop read API` which it talks to using
    `gds-api-adapters`.
