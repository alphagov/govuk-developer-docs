    now getting need information via the `backdrop read API` which it talks to using

    Application that was at one time used for management of "artefacts", route
    registration, tagging and search indexing. The functionality was slowly moved
    to the new publishing platform during migration (2016/2017). In February 2017
    the last functionality was removed. Most features moved to
    [publishing-api](/repos/publishing-api.html) (like route registration), managing
    of artefacts was moved to [publisher](/repos/publisher.html), and tagging moved
    to [content-tagger](/repos/content-tagger.html). Publishing apps became
    responsible for sending their pages to search.

    whereas the add significant times to builds and are extremely
    complicated to debug when they break. They were retired in
