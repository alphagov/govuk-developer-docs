    A temporary proxy to aid with the migration of content-store from
    MongoDB to PostgreSQL. We had two versions of content-store
    running side-by-side, one using each database. The proxy sat in front of them,
    forwarding all incoming requests to its PRIMARY_UPSTREAM (at first the MongoDB
    version, later PostgreSQL) and returned that response. It also replayed the
    request to its SECONDARY_UPSTREAM (at first the PostgreSQL version, later
    MongoDB). This allowed us to compare the responses from both versions to
    satisfy ourselves that the two were completely equivalent and address any
    differences, before we migrated production.

    The migration was completed in December 2023, and the proxy repo was archived
    on 3rd Jan 2024.

    the last functionality was removed. Most features moved to
    [publishing-api](/repos/publishing-api.html) (like route registration), managing
    of artefacts was moved to [publisher](/repos/publisher.html), and tagging moved
    to [content-tagger](/repos/content-tagger.html). Publishing apps became
    responsible for sending their pages to search.
